Also the super mega amount of content is mostly in terms of rooms, when it comes to creatures we have a pretty manageable amount - not necessarily by choice but because I can&#039;t cram them out fast enough hehe. So it seems like what we&#039;re going towards is a very large world with not quite as many (species of) creatures in it, for good or for worse. This definitely creates the risk that people will find the world &quot;dull&quot; as there&#039;s a lot of rooms, but not a lot of variation as to what you actually find in it. However I think we have some measures to steer clear of that - first of all the region system, where the regions are not too huge in themselves and they each provide some visual variation. Then to that comes that many of the rooms are interesting in themselves, you&#039;d want to explore them for the sake of it, Knytt-style. And then we have the set-pieces, which will be a boon to the explorer every now and then. So I don&#039;t think we need to worry all too much, but hey, who knows!<br><br>If it does become a problem that the world is too big, I think you could pretty easily hook up the regions with a few new connections to solve that. Like, if each region has just a few &quot;highway rooms&quot; that connect its region gates, that would effectually make the world smaller, and then the other rooms would exist more in the periphery to be explored or not. That&#039;s sort of the idea we&#039;re already working with right, just a bit more extreme?<br><br><b>Update 431</b><br><br>Now I have the three game over modes working, rain, flood and floodAndRain. Each of them exist and work, but I don&#039;t yet have a system for how to decide which will occur in which room - that leads into a small can of worms which is some kind of interface for manipulating room-specific settings. I&#039;ve also connected them with sound triggers, so James can get started on that. We have run into a bit of a catch 22 with some of the sound stuff that requires more sophisticated code - what generally happens is that I ask James if I can get the sounds in advance because I feel I need them to tune the sound manipulating code. Then James tells me that he can&#039;t really work on them until I&#039;ve placed the triggers so he can see how they behave in the game... I think the solution we&#039;re gonna roll with is that I put in a simple placeholder behavior to get James started, and then when he has some material I can go back and do a bit of tuning. We&#039;ll see how it works.<br><br>Other project of the day has been hooking the vulture up with sound triggers. Making the woooosh loops for the wings was a lot of trouble, but now I&#039;m pretty happy with how it sounds using a placeholder sound. There&#039;s a sound trigger for when the hard (metal/glass?) feathers bump into terrain, which pitch-shifts according to feather length, which sounds pretty cool, I&#039;m really looking forward to what James comes up with for that! There are a few triggers left to be placed, then I&#039;ll try to get a few water interaction sound triggers in as well before shipping it to James so he can get started on sound stuff after finishing the Shadow Urban region up.

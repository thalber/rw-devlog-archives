Thanks! As I said I&#039;m pretty sure we&#039;ll return to it for polish, so I&#039;ll try it out then&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308161700im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/hand-thumbsup-r.gif" alt="Hand Thumbs Up Right" border="0"> <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308161700im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/hand-thumbsup-r.gif" alt="Hand Thumbs Up Right" border="0"><br><br><b>Update 458</b><br><br>New creature coming up!<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308161700im_/https://giant.gfycat.com/VerifiableBaggyAsiansmallclawedotter.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>The idea is that this critter will be able to lay on the floor like a big sea elephant/grub, but then it can also shoot up in the sky with looooong extendable legs.<br><br>I&#039;m very inspired by Dali&#039;s long legged elephants for this one.<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308161700im_/http://www.bodyofart.com/site_media/user/galleries/lewisnn/exhibition-project/homeboaboa-envsrcboawebsitesite_mediadali-les-elephants.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="200" border="0"><br><br>With these long legs it will be able to stride across the worm grass fields and then pull them in and lay down to eat some sort of plant in its grazing pastures in between. The leg movement is supposed to be a <i>little bit</i> less clumsy, though I don&#039;t know how good I can make it. Good thing it&#039;s all fantasy creatures &nbsp;<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308161700im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0"><br><br>I&#039;ll work a bit more on locomotion, and then my plan is that in the skinning phase I will draw legs on top of these tentacles that are only somewhat true to their orientation, hopefully enabling me to fake a slightly less wobbly movement haha!

Oh don&#039;t worry guys <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150823032336im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/grin.gif" alt="Grin" border="0"> I&#039;ve just been quiet because I&#039;ve been doing some classic non-devlog stuff these last couple of days, like finishing up the last region, providing tiles for the new region etc. But yeah, maybe this deer thing got a tiiiiiiiny bit annoying somewhere halfway through page 3&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150823032336im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/cheesy.gif" alt="Cheesy" border="0"><br><br>Both James and I like the deer, and that&#039;s generally what we go by. I&#039;m a fan of the beard suggestion though, maybe I will try something like that out in polish pass! However, the deer in its current form took something like 2.5 weeks alone, and we just have to put a pin in it for now. <br><br>At the moment I&#039;m making tiles and palettes for this new region we&#039;ve gotten into. This one is going to have a lot of palettes and fun custom work, as we plan for it to be kind of the big end-of-game scene and want to spice stuff up quite a bit! Now we are starting to tread some spoiler territory though, and maybe not everything in this region will make it to the devlog as we want you guys to experience it for yourselves. Super excited to finally be reaching that point of the development!

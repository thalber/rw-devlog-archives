That the big end-of-game scene in the aftermentioned region is encountered towards the end of the game? I&#039;m guessing narrative events funnel you toward certain regions...<br></div><br>1) oh yes, totally. thats been my life for teh past 2 years<br><br>2) there are quite a few soft lock-and-key-ish aspects, and a few main ones that have to be figured out in order to traverse some of the later endgame regions. but none of them are hard barriers per se, they are more to guide the player to some essential spots where certain narrative / development events can take place. but in replay, in NG+ or just a fresh game, a player who has previously gone through the game should have pretty much full run of the map with the knowledge they accumulated. if you know what you are doing and have a plan and some outside resources (or are really lucky), you can access any point from the start.

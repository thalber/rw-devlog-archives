I&#039;d love to just an empty room or some enclosed maps, where you can spawn different species to watch how they interact, play around with tube worms, etc.<br><br>Especially watching the different species. I have to say, this game has this incredible voyeuristic quality, where simply watching the different creatures is just fascinating. After my slugcat gets killed, I tend to watch for a few more minutes to watch lizards fight over the carcass or fight each other. It&#039;s so cool.<br><br>I&#039;d love to have a separate mode to enjoy that without having to worry about the coming rain or other dangers<br><br>Like a mode titled &quot;Vivarium&quot; or something like that <br></div><br>yes definitely! we were actually just talking about that a little bit. in the old Lingo alpha, multiplayer and sandbox were combined, so you could throw creatures and players into levels of your choosing and just go at it. what were planning now is a bit of an elaboration on that, tying in the narrative portion of the game so as you explore the world in single player / co-op, you are unlocking new content (rooms, regions, creatures, etc) for use in the multiplayer/sandbox mode. this will get us a lot of extra mileage from fun stuff like the water elements, tube worm grapple, cicada jumps, etc., that otherwise would just be confined to a region or two.<br><br>but more related to your question, i know Joar is super keen on having some sort of ecosystem observation mode, so a &quot;vivarium&quot; that pulls from these same elements sounds perfecto.<br><br><br><br>Also hey hello hi im back from PAX! Did a ton of interviews and talks with media peeps about Rain World, so i expect to see that stuff popping up the next week. Probably nothing new for you long-time devlog readers, but who knows! <br><br>We had front and center billing at the adult swim games booth, which was pretty slick...<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308162607im_/https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CNhbqg-VAAAicmA.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br><br>and got to finally see the new slugcat pup plushies that Sanshee is going to be putting out...<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308162607im_/https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CNxAf0VUAAAliXz.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br><br>and most importantly, the game didnt even freeze ONCE. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308162607im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/tearsofjoy.gif" alt="Tears of Joy" border="0"><br><br><br>

I really like all these creatures. But what about the biomechanical touch the seaworm got? I thought you would like more creatures to have it. Would fit the setting perfect. And it adds a lot of creapyness. Until now, only Jaws has mechanical jaws.<br></div><br>Good call! This one will have a quite interesting design ~ I&#039;ll not spoil it but let you guys see it as it develops!<br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308162607/https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?PHPSESSID=hebvhg628p0lfdgf61ut1mejn5&amp;topic=25183.msg1175045#msg1175045">Quote from: Christian on September 01, 2015, 04:23:09 PM</a></div><div class="quote">...Like a mode titled &quot;Vivarium&quot; or something like that <br></div><br>Yes, I&#039;m also fond of this aspect so I&#039;d like to see something like this go in the game. Maybe not a separate mode per se, but something where you can just watch, maybe as the credits roll or the start screen or something. Also I don&#039;t see why sandbox mode should force you to spawn players, you should be able to just place a few critters in the arena and see what happens!<br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308162607/https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?PHPSESSID=hebvhg628p0lfdgf61ut1mejn5&amp;topic=25183.msg1175111#msg1175111">Quote from: TheWing on September 01, 2015, 09:12:29 PM</a></div><div class="quote">...it seems like he&#039;s not moving with his legs, but rather just dragging tentacles around where he moves..? <br></div><br>Yep ~ that&#039;s actually a perfect description of the task. What is going on is the latter, what I try to make it look like is the former. It&#039;s the same for all the creatures in the game, none of them actually &quot;move with their legs&quot; in an actual sense, rather they are just pulled along and then made to look like they&#039;re affected by the legs with smoke and mirrors. I&#039;ve been achieving results I&#039;m happy with for the other creatures, so I think I will for this one too!<br><br>

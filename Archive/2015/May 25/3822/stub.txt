#shelters, I&#039;m basically agreeing with you guys&#039; reasoning - for world building purposes they should definitely close, for gameplay reasons they should definitely not. Like hypedupdawg points out, the idea is that they should not really feel like they&#039;re designed for you - nothing in the world is. That said, looking at them it seems reasonable to assume that they are built as <i>shelters</i>, which they can be without specifically being built as shelters <i>for you</i>. This is world building stuff that is a bit fuzzy, and I don&#039;t want to explain or make explicit too much about the world. I think though that maybe we can sort of walk a line where not everything needs a very reasonable explanation - one of my favorite games is Matt Thorsons &quot;An Untitled Story&quot; a strange metroidvania where there is a million things throughout the large world that doesn&#039;t have an explanation, little hovering sparks that you can jump on for example. It&#039;s all very weird and if you start thinking about who placed the little sparks everywhere and why, you can&#039;t really come up with anything reasonable except &quot;the game needed to work&quot;. STILL, the world feels really good, because it follows its own logic rather consistently. There&#039;s a ton of gamey stuff, but that just feels like the way this particular world works. <br><br>Rain World is perhaps a world that attempts to approximate physical reality more closely than An Untitled Story, but I think we must count on at least a little bit of lea way like that in this project too. There is a ton of weird stuff going on already, the shortcuts being the most notable example (you crawl into a thing, become a couple of dots and tick away through some kind of pipe until you pop out elsewhere, wtf? Not to mention all of it being 2D!!) and some of these will just have to be made a part of this world - once they feel like a natural part of the world they won&#039;t be jarring any more, and might even add to the experience by setting this world apart from ours. <br><br>Right now the shelters and the region gates trigger the same way - you run to a specific spot, and have to stand still for a couple of frames for them to activate. This is a little piece of logic, but it obviously doesn&#039;t make much sense from a physical or technical point of view. A motion sensor would&#039;ve rusted, right... This is more the game&#039;s logic than anything else, and you could even argue about whether it&#039;s canon - maybe in the <i>World </i>of RW it works some other way, but in the <i>Game</i> of Rain World it works this way, similarly to how Master Chief probably will lose the bullets left in a clip if he reloads in the <i>World </i>of Halo, but they&#039;ve excluded that part from the <i>Game </i>of Halo. Really fuzzy grey areas here!<br><br>@easternDragon, maybe, yes, don&#039;t know, yes! Saving might depend on how rough serialization etc is, so it&#039;s a technical thing. It&#039;s obviously going in sooner or later. Spears disappearing should definitely be fixed! Fun bug trivia - actually they don&#039;t disappear, they turn into rocks while remaining stuck to the creature, but because most creatures are black and the rocks are also black you don&#039;t see them... Vultures through short cuts, I don&#039;t know... James and I never considered it a bug and we rather like it, but no one else seems to, so maybe. Region gates should definitely be in, that&#039;s basically the big thing with this build we&#039;re working on!<br><br>@New peeps, hi and welcome!

The only problem I have so far is that Unity&#039;s volume control for samples seems really weird. Between 10% and 100% volume I can barely hear any difference, and pretty much the entire scale is squeezed together between 0% and 10%. I can sort of hack around this problem by just doing a Pow operation on the volume with an exponent of 3 or something, but it puzzles me. Does anyone know anything about this?&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309173059im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/whome.gif" alt="Who, Me?" border="0"></div>Sounds like what happens when sound is scaled linearly instead of logarithmically. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309173059/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weber%E2%80%93Fechner_law#The_case_of_sound" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weber%E2%80%93Fechner_law#The_case_of_sound</a><br></div><br>This seems reasonable! Why would it work like that though? My bypass sort of works, so I&#039;m just rolling with that now, but it still weirds me out. <br><br>Today I&#039;ve been working more on the sound engine, which seems to be working in about every way I want it to work now, except from playing ambient sounds and music. It does play samples though, and the samples can be attached to an object in the game, assigned a static position, or just played as a &quot;disembodied&quot; sound which has a pan assigned.<br><br>On top of that I&#039;ve been writing this sort of intricate input syntax for James to use when putting the sound in the game. What it&#039;s basically about is that all the sound triggers are named in a text file, and by writing some simple instructions James can tell the game what to do sound-wise on that trigger. The system can do stuff such as randomizing pitch or volume within an interval, pick a random sample from a list, play multiple samples at different volumes at once, etc etc. <br><br>Now the task at hand is basically just to place a trillion sound triggers in the code. At first my method was to scroll through the code and try to come up with sound triggers to put in there, but that was not very effective so now I&#039;ve switched the process around, and write a list of whatever sounds I can think of first, and then try to find where in the code the trigger should go. Lots of work. I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll actually attempt to place ALL the triggers before sending it over to James, but I want to have a good chunk in.

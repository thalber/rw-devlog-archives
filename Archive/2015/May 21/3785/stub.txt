Oh god I love this so much!!! It already looks better than I imagined! You guys don&#039;t know how long I&#039;ve been waiting for this&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309173111im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/tearsofjoy.gif" alt="Tears of Joy" border="0"><br><br>Complete agree with Christian, the radial spray through the walls looks great, adds to the perceived intensity and depth. Feature rather than a bug! Also, maybe it&#039;s hard to tell from this pic, but the rain seems to blur and obscure the exposed terrain so much that I wonder if the plants will be seen as anything but a vague outline, which would be perfect imho!<br><br>A few months ago I did a survey of literally all instances of rain in videogames, and it was pretty bad, even in modern/next gen games. This is already better than any of them, so if that&#039;s one day&#039;s progress then HELL YEAH.&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309173111im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/hand-metal-r.gif" alt="Hand Metal Right" border="0"> <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309173111im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/hand-metal-r.gif" alt="Hand Metal Right" border="0"> <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309173111im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/hand-metal-r.gif" alt="Hand Metal Right" border="0"><br><br>I mean, it&#039;s called Rain World, we had some expectations to meet!

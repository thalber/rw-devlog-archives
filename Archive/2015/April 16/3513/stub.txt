@marcgfx, yeah def, but the editor runs in macromedia director, written in lingo, which is sort of terrible, and it&#039;s just a jumbled mess of horrible UI and old remnants of stuff that&#039;s no longer used. We have officially given up hope on it looooong ago, and we don&#039;t think it&#039;s worth it to spend any time on it. We&#039;re just going to use it to make levels for this game, and then say good-bye to it forever - think of it as an old car that you hope will have <i>just </i>enough life left in it to be able to drive all the way to the scrapyard&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309173059im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/cheesy.gif" alt="Cheesy" border="0"> So yeah but no, I won&#039;t spend time slimming the level editor, I&#039;ll just make it do what we need it to do and then learn my lesson for the next project.<br><br>@Crispy75, each screen texture is a png of about 0.5mb, and the level geometry (once the AI data is baked in) is about the same, so a screen is ~ 1 meg. James hopes to have 700 of those by the end of it o_0 The disk space of the code is negligible, but the music+sfx will likely occupy some space as well.<br><br><b>Question</b><br>Does anyone have any experience with loading sounds dynamically in Unity? I set up this huge system for James to be able to import and work with sounds from a folder, only for us to realize that the reason it had been working on my computer was because I was running the unity editor in the background, which added metadata to the sounds as I put them in the resources folder. James is running the stand-alone, which doesn&#039;t merge the files into the unity project, and as an effect the loading of the sound files doesn&#039;t work <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309173059im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0"><br><br>I&#039;ve been looking at solutions for dynamic loading of sounds in Unity, with no results so far. Theoretically I think I should be able to use a WWW similarly to how I load the levels, and that seems to work to a degree - I get AudioClips out of it instead of null references or something, and there are no error messages, but the AudioClips don&#039;t play. Or they play, but they&#039;re empty. Their isReadyToPlay property is perpetually false. Anyone has ideas?&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309173059im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/beg.gif" alt="Beg" border="0">

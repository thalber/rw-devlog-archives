Haha yeah I can imagine! That qoute from me sort of exposes how incredibly little I know about sound design though - I just took what I myself do and changed &quot;writing and deleting a single line of code that does very very little difference&quot; for the knobs&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308154738im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/cheesy.gif" alt="Cheesy" border="0"> So, it&#039;s sort of an awesome thing that I&#039;m not the one doing the audio lol. Whatever wizardry he&#039;s up to - knobs or not - he probably needs a little time though, re-inventing stuff is always a biggie.<br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308154738/https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?PHPSESSID=fomlg6prgi3ib3amjvchtlecr0&amp;topic=25183.msg1130149#msg1130149">Quote from: fall_ark on April 16, 2015, 10:42:57 AM</a></div><div class="quote"><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308154738/https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?PHPSESSID=fomlg6prgi3ib3amjvchtlecr0&amp;topic=25183.msg1130129#msg1130129">Quote from: JLJac on April 16, 2015, 09:36:15 AM</a></div><div class="quote">Yeah I&#039;m super stoked too! But it might be a couple of days, James says he needs to re-invent the sound world somewhat to fit the new less low-res art style, and that sounds to me like sitting very very many hours with headphones turning knobs very very slightly. And also my blunder with the import stuff which stalled us for an entire day... I have no doubts it&#039;s going to be super sweet though!<br></div><br><b><i>But it might be a couple of days</i></b><br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308154738im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/whome.gif" alt="Who, Me?" border="0"> You guys really are something else.

So haha, all promises withdrawn! Take that with several bath tubs of salt!<br><br>Another thing that got kind of lost in the audio trigger frustration is that James recently sent me a put-together version of the Sky Islands region! And it&#039;s sweeeeeeet! I haven&#039;t played it very much yet, but I&#039;ve had a couple of good runs and first of all it looks amazing. Weird antennae and relay structures, a lot of vertigo and here and there serene (or would be serene if it wasn&#039;t for the lizards) little sky islands. Plus, cicadas moving around, which is frustrating and fun. Lots of cicada jumping! I have a few memorable moments already, such as entering a cicada hive that&#039;s currently raided by two vultures, and standing at the bottom of a pit with a green lizard getting closer and closer, desperately waiting for my captive cicada to stop being exhausted so I can jump out of there. I got out a split second before the green lizard got me! Really nice to see how the mechanics interact to create interesting situations.

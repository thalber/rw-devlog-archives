<span style="font-size: 16pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>AUDIO STUFFF: THE RETURN. Day 1</b></span><br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308154738im_/https://i.imgur.com/djUZk5hl.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>YES, all the things that Joar said. I admit to being a little apprehensive about it, as conceptual changes will inevitably scrap a bit of the past couple of years of audio work. But it is necessary! The game has evolved significantly in the past year, and the audio needs to evolve with it.<br><br><b>Audio rant below, pls feel free to skip</b><br><br>One thing thats central to any self-respecting professional audio fascist is aesthetic consistency. For the lingo build, I had a pretty tight concept built around the idea of Rain World as more of a quick, &quot;retro pixel platformer&quot; (remember when people did that?), and so limited the tools used for the audio and SFX to what hardware would have been used for 16bit games. At this point &quot;chiptune&quot; is more of a buzzword and implies a genre more than anything else, so i&#039;ll avoid that and just say that the tools were simple chip-based additive/subtractive synthesis, 2 operator FM, basic wavetable / formant synthesis, and some basic sample / PCM stuff. Nothing that you wouldn&#039;t find in a classic SNES/Neo Geo/Sega CD game. <br><br>But that was 2 years ago! The game is now modern and sexy with shaders and dynamic lighting and who knows maybe particle effects, so limiting the audio toolkit to 90s tech just doesn&#039;t fit any more, and would be totally arbitrary. I had been anticipating this a bit the past few months and have been experimenting, filling out the sound profile with both hi-fi synthesis elements and manipulating junk audio sources (you might recall that track i posted built from a conversation Joar and I had at PAX), trying to extend the palette in both directions. Might still have to cut a bunch of that old stuff tho! <br><br>Now, the junk audio thing is funny, because the reason I started messing with that in the context of rain world was because of the SFX samples that Joar was using before I joined the project. As he tells it to me, he just made them with his laptop mic, recording moving papers around and slapping rulers to the table. The resulting sounds are a lot of messy distorted stuff, indistinct white noise elements and compression artifacts. AKA perfect for Rain World! I wouldn&#039;t want to use them raw, but if balanced, eq&#039;d right, run through some nice filters and placed in the proper context, it sounds pretty cool. So I&#039;ve moved to incorporating use of manipulated junk audio throughout the overall audio concept, and am pretty stoked with the results. Imagine you are being hunted through the deep darkness by some huge creature while something like this is playing in the background: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308154738/https://clyp.it/jjn25egr" target="_blank">https://clyp.it/jjn25egr</a> Not all the music will be like this of course, but in the right context it creates a pretty amazing mood imho.<br><br>I dont think Joar was totally on board with this use of his samples initially, but audio is a really interesting medium. if you know what you are doing, you can basically make anything out of anything else. For instance, here is what a korg product rep can do with 1 sample on a cheap hardware sampler in 6 minutes: <br><iframe width="640" height="385" src="//web.archive.org/web/20210308154738if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/THImd641WXk?fs=1&amp;start=" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><br>So basically this entire post so far is me justifying that, yes, I, a &quot;professional sound designer&quot;, will be using Joar&#039;s laptop mic recorded crumpled paper and ruler thwack sounds as audio source material, and its for the sake of aesthetic consistency, LOL<br><br><b>/AudioRant, it is now safe to continue reading</b><br><br>So on to implementation! Past day or so was spent familiarizing myself with Joar&#039;s audio language and establishing a new workflow. Like the rest of my life right now, it is a horrific mess of text files:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308154738im_/https://i.imgur.com/4XIlrKJl.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>But as hellish as it looks, I am super happy with the results so far! My gameplan was to first do an updated version of the Lingo SFX implementation for some practice with the language and to get something to work from. I had expected that to take at least until the weekend, but managed to get a basic sound-set that already sounds significantly better than that in just the afternoon! Super encouraging results.<br><br>Anyway, I hope that wasn&#039;t TOO boring. The actual audio work itself is literally days of me moving knobs around, so that would be even worse to read! I&#039;ll post some video of this rough audio build tomorrow when I have all the bat sfx triggers sorted out, and post updates on how that evolves through to a more final version.

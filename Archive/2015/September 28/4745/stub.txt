there is a system of inheritability in there, so it wont be all that bad! Like with the lighting and palette tools, Joar has it set so ill be able to set audio templates for regions/subreigons. though... if my workflow with the lighting and palette is any indication, ill likely wind up doing most of it by hand because i am a fuss. The 1% lighting blend difference between rooms matters to me! XD<br><br>really looking forward to it. my only sadness is that i cant dive right in just yet. Sooooooon!

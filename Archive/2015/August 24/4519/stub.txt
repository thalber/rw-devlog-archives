<b>Update 465</b><br><br>Working on a new creature! This one is going to need a bit of rope physics, which I&#039;m painstakingly trying to figure out. I did try my hand at this with the lantern mouse, but there I could always assume a static base position - here I have to consider both ends of the rope moving as a possibility. <br><br>I&#039;ve figured out that as long as the rope ends manage their own terrain collision, the rope itself should only have to care about convex corners, which should simplify the task a bit by making the things necessary to think about a lot fewer. <br><br>I have managed to get something together that works theoretically. In practice though, it&#039;s not perfect yet - sometimes the &quot;sweep&quot; the rope does for corners will miss a corner, and the rope can only create one new bend point in a frame, as well as some other problems. The theory should be sound though, so if I work with it some more I imagine this solution should work.<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308162423im_/https://giant.gfycat.com/VacantBeneficialAnnelid.gif" alt="" border="0">

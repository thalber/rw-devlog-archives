Hi! Welcome&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308163203im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0"><br><br><b>Update 478</b><br><br>This one has been surprisingly troublesome for not being very large. Now I think I have it to the point where I can smooth stuff over a bit in the skinning phase and have it look okay, and the locomotion is also reliable enough to always get the creature from A to B.<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308163203im_/https://fat.gfycat.com/SpectacularPointlessBedbug.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>I&#039;ve been tuning numbers all day... And still ... not ... quite ... there. But, I&#039;ll move on for now, maybe the later stuff I add will magically make it work. <br><br>As you can see from the gif it has two modes, one when staying still or moving short distances, and then a sprint. Transitioning between the two certainly isn&#039;t flawless, but I think the skin phase can do quite a lot to cover that up.

Ah yes! Creature eggs are still definitely planned. We&#039;d like to make them an overlap between single player and multiplayer/sandbox mode, where discovering a creature egg and bringing it back to your den in single player / co-op unlocks that creature&nbsp; for use in sandbox&nbsp; / multi. Also possibly for use in a capture the flag mode sort of thing in multiplayer. So yes, big plans for the eggs!<br><br>As for logo stuff, there may be some news on that in the relatively near future&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150627030417im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0"><br><br>We&#039;re just getting back from travels in the next few days, so updates soon.

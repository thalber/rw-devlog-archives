The purple tentacles are passive, so it&#039;d have to be the wings if any. It does reach with its neck though, but it&#039;s not very long. When James and I really start to try to build gameplay around it we&#039;ll see, maybe it&#039;ll need grabby arms or it&#039;s too easy.<br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309172526/https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?PHPSESSID=og4dpuvtn7699luboidttjjhj3&amp;topic=25183.msg1102788#msg1102788">Quote from: Christian on January 22, 2015, 08:24:33 PM</a></div><div class="quote">Also is there going to be some kind of membrane or skin between the &quot;fingers&quot; of the wings? <br></div>Nope, I don&#039;t think so, but the &quot;fingers&quot; will look slightly different - now they&#039;re just squares.<br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309172526/https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?PHPSESSID=og4dpuvtn7699luboidttjjhj3&amp;topic=25183.msg1102788#msg1102788">Quote from: Christian on January 22, 2015, 08:24:33 PM</a></div><div class="quote">Edit: that slick move the slugcat pulls off in the first GIF is awesome.

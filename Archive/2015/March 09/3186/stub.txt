Hi! Post-PAX me writing, so please excuse me being all tired and groggy @_@ We had a really good time though, and it was awesome meeting everyone! <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150627031034im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/grin.gif" alt="Grin" border="0"> Showing off the game went well, and people seemed to be able to grasp the controls etc pretty easily, so we&#039;re happy about that! Thanks to everyone stopping by!<br><br>Really cool to see you guys playing around with the alpha! Hope you&#039;re having fun with it.<br><br>On vultures in shortcuts, haha... Remember that even if the game has progressed since the last build, it&#039;s still alpha - nothing is set in stone. At this point pretty much every creature needs to spawn in a &quot;den&quot;, which is essentially an un-marked shortcut, and because of that I made the vulture able to go through the shortcuts. Also I wanted it to be able to reach more areas, like even the rooms that are not connected to open sky, but maybe it&#039;s dangerous enough without that. I&#039;ll try out what it plays like to have the vulture unable to go through shortcuts, if it&#039;s better, we&#039;ll roll with that! I do agree that it&#039;s a bit weird that it can&#039;t fit in the 2-tile space between the metal beams, but it can fit in the shortcut. So basically, remember that it&#039;s an early version you&#039;re playing, we are going to try to sort stuff out&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150627031034im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/hand-thumbsup-r.gif" alt="Hand Thumbs Up Right" border="0"> <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150627031034im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/hand-thumbsup-r.gif" alt="Hand Thumbs Up Right" border="0"><br><br>

Oh interesting! I&#039;m not convinced about those Rs of yours, to me they have a bit of club foot with that one leg being thicker and extending to outside of the curved line, but I really like that W!<br><br>The font is based on a public domain font called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308161700/https://www.dafont.com/rodondo.font" target="_blank">rodondo</a>, but has undergone some modifications where I&#039;ve for example made it thinner and adjusted a bunch of stuff around. If you look at the R there you&#039;ll see that it&#039;s actually even more pinched together than the one I&#039;m rolling, I&#039;ve been moving that leg out a bit. So I agree with you in kind but not in scale, if that makes sense &nbsp;<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308161700im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0"><br><br>The all white slugcat looks pretty nice IMO! Actually I have been doing a few tests like that myself as well, as a logo needs to be able to work in one color print. Maybe the silhouette could be a bit more distinctive in some places, but as said we&#039;re rushing to a deadline right now and it&#039;s pretty likely we&#039;ll return to this down the line.<br><br>As for the reduced color count on the slugcat, that was my attempt to clean it up a bit and make it closer to the graphics of the game, but I would be totally up for seeing what a smooth unlimited color finish would look like as well! As long as the outline is sharp rather than blurry and there&#039;s a way to get around obvious brush strokes. Maybe when we get Del back!

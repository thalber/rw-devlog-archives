Hi everybody! Yesterday and today I&#039;m working on a creature that I won&#039;t announce here - because it&#039;s a fairly quick one (not to say it&#039;s not cool though <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308163009im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0">) I felt that this way you guys would get the most surprise per day of devlog silence, if you get me.<br><br>There are a few creatures in the game now that haven&#039;t made it to the internet - not very many at all, but hopefully enough to make the actual game a bit exciting even for you most veteran devlog readers come release. <br><br>Normal posts start again tomorrow!

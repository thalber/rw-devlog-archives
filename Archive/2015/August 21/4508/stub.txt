My hope is that this will allow James to make some cool super-intricate looking machines. <br><br>James is working on an area now that is looking preeeeetty awesome! There&#039;ll be a lot of very large tiles, some intricate machinery, and some cool visual effects. Much looking forward to see what&#039;s gonna come out of this!

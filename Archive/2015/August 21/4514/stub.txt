Thanks! Actually &quot;quasi 3D&quot; is a pretty good way to describe all the background graphics in the game. The level editor creates 30 bitmaps, each representing a layer in the z-dimension and then bakes them together into a composite which saves the depth value of each pixel. This means that the final image you view could be thought of as a still projection of a crude little voxel space. Most assets are created layer-by-layer and then interpreted by the editor so that they all line up, forming a rough (and very flat) 3d shape.<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150823032336im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/08/22/4nDxY.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>This is why making new assets takes so long - I can&#039;t just draw them, I have to figure the three dimensional shape out, lay it out as layers, write the instructions for the editor to place everything in the correct layer, etc. <br><br>When it comes to the actual visual 3D effect, some assets work better than others, and I&#039;m really happy about these chains! However, even the boring boxy assets have a bit of the effect going on. If you look at the chains screenshot you can aaaaaalmost see how on the left hand box, you get a little glimpse of its right face, and on the right hand box you get a little glimpse of the left face.<br><br>The saved depth value of each pixel is used for basically every shader effect that looks good in the game, that&#039;s like the one magic trick <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150823032336im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0"> The shadows playing over objects in the background for example are very simple - just fetch the depth of pixel (x,y), depending on that depth step a certain amount of pixels diagonally up/left to say, pixel (x-6, y-8). Once there, check if there is something rendered in the sprite layer at that location - if so, the pixel should be shadowed.

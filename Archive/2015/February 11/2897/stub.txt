as ambitious as it may sound, yep thats the idea! or as near to that as we can reasonably get. Joar&#039;s concept is the entire world active as a constant interactive and autonomous ecosystem that is steadily roiling around in the background as you play through: creatures hunting creatures in distant lands as you make your way through, so by the time you arrive all manner of unexpected strangeness has happened. All that effort spent in the engine creation months ago on abstracting off-screen AI behavior to state descriptions was to make this concept (hopefully) CPU feasible when scaled up. <br><br>Hiccups in this 4-region test aside, i think thats still generally the game plan. There may not *really* be a need for the game to keep track of 600ish eventual rooms filled with creatures existing at every moment though, so thats something to get a plan for. But, ideally we could tackle that at a time when we&#039;re not already super crunching to get a stable build together for PAX&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309172842im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/tired.gif" alt="Tired" border="0"><br><br>back to questions about the interconnected map stuff, if you are interested here is an older working concept world map. things have evolved far enough from this that im comfortable sharing it without fear of spoilers or anything, and it shows you the general idea of the large interconnected world:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309172842im_/https://i.imgur.com/Yxr9VCal.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Each color represents a region, and each square a screen, with grouped squares being multi-screen rooms. The regions geographically located next to each other are all connected, but there are also a number of fast-travel-esque connections between distant regions as well. The concept is that each room is a sort of movement puzzle to get through, and each region is its own puzzle of those puzzles, exploring various gameplay elements, geometries and creature territories, and then to get through the world you basically have to navigate a puzzle of puzzle of puzzles.<br><br>But as it is now, the 4 regions we currently have hooked up are roughly equivalent in size and complexity to the scope of this entire map!&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309172842im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/shocked.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0"> <br><br>i think the final version will probably keep people occupied for a while.

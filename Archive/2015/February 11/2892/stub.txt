<b>mega_world region combining update: </b><br><br>so the good news is that my computer didnt blow up, even a little bit! running rain world with the 4 simultaneous regions was totally possible, and even playable to a certain extent. but the bad news is that, unsurprisingly, running 100+ interconnected rooms simultaneously with dozens and dozens of active AIs all moving about creates some pretty serious performance drag. and if that&#039;s only 1/3rd of the content were aiming for, seems like zoning or a more region-based AI realization is almost certainly necessary.<br><br>fortunately we&#039;ve planned for this. the game is already divided into large regions which we know work just fine, and in fact just this evening we were discussing the aesthetics of region transition gates which will be implemented anyway, so everything is there for zoning already. other than some vague &quot;world spanning event&quot; ideas discussed, this doesnt change anything really. plus, even if the huge perpetual world concept DID wind up somehow working for PC, we very likely would have had to go this route anyways for some of the consoles we are planning for, so seems like this is the right direction to build in regardless. <br><br>joar is checking it out to make sure that its not randomly something else that&#039;s creating the slowdowns, and after that we&#039;ll talk it over and make a plan!<br><br>anyway, here is a screen of the abstracted room overlay when running the 4 regions:<br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309172842im_/https://i.imgur.com/bhprF9pl.png" alt="" border="0"> <br><br>and thats only what would fit on the screen of course! it goes on and on and on XD<br><br><b>***UPDATE**</b><br>Apparently in Joar&#039;s build, these slowdowns aren&#039;t a problem. So that is a good sign! Perhaps the slowdowns I&#039;m seeing are related to some other issue that has since been fixed. That would be quite nice! There are other minor issues, but at least for the time being we may not have to chop up the world just yet. Which is GOOD because we have plenty of other things to do <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309172842im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/tongue.gif" alt="Tongue" border="0">

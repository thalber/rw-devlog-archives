Wow, that poster is really really cool!&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308162656im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/grin.gif" alt="Grin" border="0"><br><br><b>Update 471</b><br><br>Tentacle task allocation - blue is locomotion, green is checking a sound, red is hunting (without being able to actually catch me atm).<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308162656im_/https://fat.gfycat.com/PortlyWholeGreendarnerdragonfly.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>The creature is blind and the touch/hearing hunting behavior is now working. It plays weird, not like any of the other predators in the game. I&#039;ll have to try it more extensively together with the grappling hook, as those will occur in the same area and the grappling hook is sort of a game changer. It&#039;s very interesting though - you can run right past it no problem, but as soon as you start jumping around those fast tentacles are right there. Will be really interesting to see how this one plays combined with other creatures.<br><br>Making it able to always keep enough tentacles dedicated to locomotion to not fall down was a bit of a challenge but I think I figured it out. Spawned 7 juicy cicadas that it felt very much like hunting with 7 different arms - and made sure that it didn&#039;t fall to the ground in that situation, which should ensure that it doesn&#039;t fall to the ground in any other situation either!

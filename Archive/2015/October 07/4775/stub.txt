Because the checkpoints are bound to the rain cycles, I won&#039;t have to save the position of every single object down to float space vectors - for the creatures that made it back to their hiding holes I can just save the den coordinate, and the rest I can throw away as dead&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20151013014157im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/hand-thumbsup-r.gif" alt="Hand Thumbs Up Right" border="0"><br><br><b>Update 487</b><br><br>Swarm room depletion. I have it set up now so that if you are eating from swarm rooms they deplete, and that data is stored to the save file. At the moment it&#039;s set up so that each cycle you can only deplete one swarm room, which will hopefully create a nice pace to forcefully propel you to explore new areas. <br><br>From my few test runs, it seems like the situation becomes pretty dire pretty quickly <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20151013014157im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/whome.gif" alt="Who, Me?" border="0"> This is going to need some balancing! There are many things that can be done though - such as spawning slightly more flies in the swarm rooms that are left when they get fewer, or lower the starvation threshold. Really fun to actually be playing this as a real game!

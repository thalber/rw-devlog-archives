These things are to some degree creatures, but they have some alien element as well.

There aren&#039;t HP bars floating over enemies heads, and they&#039;re hard to keep track of. But the more you play, the better you get at integrating the novel sensory input. Eventually you &quot;see the matrix&quot; and it&#039;s not an issue any more. You didn&#039;t buy a Lizard Detector spell, your actual brain got new skills.<br></div>Yep, this is exactly what we&#039;re going for. Potential to &quot;level up&quot;, but not through some actual scripted functionality but rather through getting more familiar with this alien world and the game mechanics used to represent it.&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308153033im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/grin.gif" alt="Grin" border="0"><br><br>@RainWorldIsAwesome, ohh, undead flies sounds menacing! Are you playing the old build, or the one just added? I.e. do you get fullscreen and a region select screen, or are you just thrown straight into the game? In the new build the bats <i>should </i>behave better, and the dead-end exits that take you nowhere and break the game should be fixed as well.<br><br>People, I&#039;m getting on the plane in a few hours! So, those of you that are attending PAX, I&#039;ll see you tomorrow&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308153033im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/grin.gif" alt="Grin" border="0"> For the rest of you, stuff might get a little more quiet here for a while, but I&#039;ll try to check in when I have opportunity, and once PAX is over I&#039;ll get back to devlog interaction. Happy weekend!

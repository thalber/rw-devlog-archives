Gives us all the opportunity to find something that we don&#039;t know anything about which is always a good thing in a game.<br></div><br>the problem is that im SO STOKED about the stuff going on in this region that its extremely hard to keep it locked up <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308163344im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/ninja.gif" alt="Ninja" border="0">. no exaggeration that this region is next-level in quite a few ways.... and then we have an arguably even CRAZIER region after that which will also be kept secret! but as you say, i think the resulting player experience of being able to see these for the first time in-game, in context, with the right setup and music and vibe, will be totally worth not spoiling. <br><br>my apologies if the devlog gets boring as a result though

Don&#039;t worry guys I&#039;m not making lizard tamer 2000 - also the spear/cicada thing wasn&#039;t really the thing I wanted to show, I just wanted to give an example to show of the Dynamic Relationships. James says I&#039;m always focusing on structure rather than content, but haha here we go again ~ the thing I&#039;ve been talking about the last couple of days isn&#039;t the specific examples I&#039;ve brought up, it&#039;s about the infrastructure: Now a creature can re-evaluate its relationships to other creatures depending on context. There&#039;s an infinity of possibilities that can come from this, and when I start adding this actual &quot;content&quot; I&#039;ll be more artful about what goes in and what doesn&#039;t, promise!<br><br>On befriending a lizard specifically, this is more of a fun idea than a serious suggestion for a common game mechanic. I&#039;m interested in procedural narratives, and I&#039;m interested in what <i>can </i>happen rather than what <i>will </i>happen most of the times. Think of dwarf fortress - the &quot;story&quot; of the game springs from its actual mechanics and its procedural elements, and once in a while something weird happens. If a lizard becoming friendly becomes a thing, that&#039;s something that would require a veeeeery specific combination of that particular lizard&#039;s personality traits and a super unusual situation - think of it as something that could happen once in a thousand play-throughs and which you&#039;ll have to post videos of to actually prove to people that it happened, rather than a game mechanic to fall back on!

Region gates technically working, and I have connected the regions we already have. Still a million things that are wonky, a million things that should be added, and approximately 400 000 things that need visual polish or to have their graphics be created, after which they too will need visual polish. However, large leaps! Moving around the world between regions makes you realize it&#039;s really, really big already. I&#039;ve been doing one Rain World tour of the regions we have without actually running through it, just jumping from room to room with the dev tools, and it still takes me like, 7 minutes to find my way through the maze. With enemies in, actually having to run everywhere and do the platforming challenges, and the rain cycle to think of, I think just getting from one region to the next will be quite an epic endeavor, probably spanning over several hibernation cycles. Still, we don&#039;t know a lot about exactly how it will play just yet - I literally hooked up the regions a few minutes ago. Hopefully this is where we will start to get a better grasp of what our game actually plays like though. My first impression is that it feels pretty different with the large connected world, which is cool!

That was sort of a paralyzing thought when expectations got hyped and it was clear we&#039;d have to make &quot;a real-ass game&quot; rather than just some little ecosystem toy. So I thought at the very least we could make sure that there would be Content. Then worst case scenario if the interactive AI ecosystem experiment didnt work out, people would still be getting their money&#039;s worth in exploration/adventure game. And also, I mean, it is called Rain WORLD not &quot;Rain Area.&quot;<br><br>At this point i think we&#039;re both pretty happy with how the experiment is working out, so hopefully the large scope is a bonus that will add a lot to the replay-ability and NG+ aspects. As its open world without much in the way of arbitrary &quot;go here to find blue key&quot; type of barriers, the player isnt going to be dragged through every room or anything, so i dont think the size will feel like a burden (to anyone but meeee&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308155358im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/cry.gif" alt="Cry" border="0"> ) I would guess a player could very easily go through the game a number of times before seeing everything, and thats always fun. <br><br>Anyway, I&#039;ve just laid the foundation really, and I cant wait till we get to the &quot;Joar adds tons of weird stuff and set pieces&quot; part :D

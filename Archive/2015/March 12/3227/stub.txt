Personally I&#039;d rather not have a glow-in-the-dark slugcat, mainly because I imagine they could do cool stuff with bioluminescence and glowing creatures and other light sources to provide enough light to progress but also be dark enough to provide a creepy atmosphere. And needing to light the way could almost be a puzzle aspect in itself<br></div>I don&#039;t know how it&#039;s done in Spelunky, but in Rougelight if you hit complete darkness you&#039;re essentially dead, unless you stumble upon some arrows by sheer luck. If you don&#039;t see your character, you can&#039;t control it. That&#039;s frustrating, not engaging, so the character should be visible. But that does not mean that anything around him should, so you can still have &quot;light the way puzzle&quot;.<br></div><br>Agreed on all points. The way it&#039;s set up now is that without a light source the cat is clearly visible, but doesn&#039;t illuminate the surrounding area. Certain aspects of the terrain are somewhat visible, as are shortcuts, glyphs, etc, so moving around in the dark is SOMEWHAT possible without a light source, but platforming and spotting hidden predators is pretty much out. <br><br>This whole dark mechanic is stuff I&#039;ve been dreaming about for over a year, so I&#039;m MEGA PSYCHED its off to such a promising start! Plans plans plans...

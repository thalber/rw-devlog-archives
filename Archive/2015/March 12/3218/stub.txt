Really like the dropping down idea! That could give you some much needed speed in the tight areas.<br><br><b>Update 406</b><br><br>Our newest mechanic that we&#039;re really excited about - darkness!<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150325022405im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/03/12/8rUnm.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Creatures also cast shadows:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150325022405im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/03/12/AIvdu.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>And some creatures can emit light!<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150325022405im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/03/12/xZ9Dz.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Note that we do <i>not </i>plan to have the main character emit light by default, in the game you&#039;re going to have to work with light sources. Just wanted to show off my shadow shader here, which is why I stuck a light to the slugcat <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150325022405im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0"><br><br>Shader seems to be fast enough - it doesn&#039;t require a second grab pass but can use the data from the first one, and the fake shadows look good in most situations. Sometimes they become a little bit detached from whatever is casting them, and as I&#039;m sure you&#039;ve noticed things that are technically in front of the light source cast shadows on the wall behind it. But just like with the Vulture shadow, mood and playability trumps optical correctness. The shader can use some more work though, and I would like to be able to make a directional light as well as the radial one, but just from thinking about what that shader code would look like I already know it&#039;s going to be an entirely different level of complicated...<br><br>Does anyone know according to what curve light diffuses? It&#039;s 1/r^2 right? Is there any good approximation that can be used within a finite radius? Right now I have (1-r)^0.3 or something, which looks a bit too steep according to me. If you just use (1-r)^0.99 or something like that you do get a smoother fall-off from the center, but the center itself becomes a sort of ugly &quot;spike&quot; of intense lightness that could definitely do with some smoothing. Maybe a gaussian curve? Is that insanity to attempt inside a shader?<br><br>Also, is there anyone with some useful tips on how to make things look glistening and wet? You sort of need normals for that, right? I&#039;m pretty happy with what I have, but if the walls could look more slippery I would definitely like to give it a try.

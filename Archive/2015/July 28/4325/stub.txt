oh we&#039;re definitely not doing steam early access or anything like that. i hope that hasnt been implied anywhere, as it was never considered. it&#039;ll be more as you have described: a closed beta with the adult swim games testers, some kickstarter backers, some old rain world pros, etc. the &quot;early access&quot; of the kickstarter tiers was for the alpha versions we&#039;ve been sending out over the past months, but they were essentially mechanical prototypes stripped of the narrative and progression elements, aka &quot;the game&quot;. <br><br>but this is just planning ahead, were not there quite yet. its as you&#039;ve said, there is a looooot of work yet to be done and we have no desire to show off our bugs just yet! <br>

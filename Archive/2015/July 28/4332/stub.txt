@christian, yeah, good point. ATM it doesn&#039;t really have a good distinction between front and back, it mostly just thinks of them as &quot;my four legs&quot;, but that could def be a nice touch!<br><br>@Keith, thank you sir! If you go one page back you can see a debug visualization of what the legs work like behind the skin that is pasted on top of them. Those tentacles are composed of two main components, the semi-transparent &quot;ghost tentacles&quot; which work in tile space and make sure that they never overlap terrain, and the jointed physics tentacles on top of that which provides a bit more plausible movement. <br><br>The creature ray-traces from its body downwards trying to find a good grip position when it moves a tentacle, and when it does so path-finds a way to it in tile space. Then the tile space &quot;ghost tentacle&quot; starts to move along that path, dragging the floaty physics tentacle with it.<br><br>On top of that I draw what you actually see in this post above. I use the positions of the physics tentacle in the debug visualization, but relate to them somewhat liberally, basically just using them to make sure that the leg is not super obviously sticking through a piece of solid terrain. The elbow bends are accomplished with a simple inverse kinematic formula, google <i>inverse kinematics</i> for more info.<br><br>Hope that was somewhat helpful, it&#039;s getting a bit late over here haha &nbsp;<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308161815im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/tired.gif" alt="Tired" border="0">

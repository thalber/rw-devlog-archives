For the logo stuff James said it ~ we are gonna return to it when the general packaging is to be touched up close to release, but for now we&#039;re really happy with what we have, especially the cute cartoony aspect actually. The mood we&#039;re going for is &quot;grim cartoon&quot;, with the slugcat being more &quot;cartoon&quot; and most other stuff being more &quot;grim&quot;. Still its black stare and the dramatic lighting conveys a hint of that gloomy atmosphere, meaning it hits the right balance for us. <br><br><b>Update 459</b><br><br>More work on locomotion and I also started a bit of the skinning process of the legs, as it didn&#039;t really make sense to work on leg movement without knowing somewhat what it will end up looking like.<br><br>Also the creature is now better at handling uneven terrain; instead of just throwing its body out over a ledge (and stumbling and falling) it carefully places a leg or two on the below level and then ease itself out.<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308161815im_/https://fat.gfycat.com/NegativeMediumFluke.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Going up a ledge is a bit more difficult as the corner tends to &quot;cut off&quot; the trailing legs and make the creature lose its support, but by having it stay a bit more clear of the actual corner this behavior is also getting better.<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308161815im_/https://fat.gfycat.com/ShortFrenchIbis.gif" alt="" border="0">

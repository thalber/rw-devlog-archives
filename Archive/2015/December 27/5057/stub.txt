Family holiday stuff stretched out for a few days longer, so sorry about the low tempo. Should be able to step it up again from now!<br><br><b>Update 499.75</b><br><br>Further scavenger individualization. <br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309211458im_/https://giant.gfycat.com/GracefulGranularDromedary.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>The faces are already fairly individual, and the body types have some stuff going on (fatness, muscularity of arms) but could definitely go with more. More importantly though I want to attach some scales and tufts to them - that stuff is usually what gives the best effort/return ratio. My experience with the other creatures is that varying the thickness of some limb between 10% and 190% is generally barely noticeable, but just sticking some random stuff on that sticks out and breaks up the silhouette has a huge impact immediately. <br><br>For this purpose I&#039;ve started on tracking their spines (red dots), therefor this mad cucaracha science. The first thing I want to do is put some tufts on their backs, for which I think I&#039;ll have to track the shoulders and find some sort of surface for the back. What&#039;s different here compared to the lizards is that these guys have a neutral (neither facing left nor right) position where they have their stomach to the camera, whereas the lizards have their backs to the camera in the neutral position. This might mean that I can&#039;t put colored decals on their back (because of overlapping issues) but will instead have to go with flat color stuff. We&#039;ll have to see how it goes though!

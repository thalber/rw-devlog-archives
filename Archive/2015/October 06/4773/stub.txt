thats because hes only showing a quick mock-up room specifically to demonstrate those new ceramic tiles and the new &quot;ceramic chaos&quot; tile effect. as im sure you can tell from the previous screenshots of actual game content, weve got toooooons of erosion and distortion tools at our disposal (like, an absurd amount), they are just not being used in this demo room.&nbsp; <br><br><br>per the save state question, even though its early and joar will probably have much more to say on this, i can tell you that the creature AIs are based out of hundreds (thousands?) of &quot;dens&quot; scattered throughout the world, which are nodes that the creatures use as nests basically to drop off food and find shelter, etc. The creatures themselves perpetually exist in abstract space throughout the current region the player is in, so they will be moving around, hunting each other, etc. off-screen, before eventually having to find a den to take shelter in when the rain cycle comes (or die.) so long story short, im guessing that the save state of the creatures will be based on their den position.<br><br>couple this mechanic with Joars individualized random-seed creatures, and there is a ton of cool stuff we can potentially do with this: creature migrations, ecosystem evolution based on survival rates, etc etc., but first things first!

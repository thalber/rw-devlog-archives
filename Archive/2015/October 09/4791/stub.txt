Yeah this stuff requires some thought. In the old game, you only had one shelter and thus eating and surviving was the natural goal. Now when there are many shelters it&#039;s easy that the standard play cycle becomes way more about trying to get to the next shelter than about surviving and returning to the same shelter. The priorities has kind of been switched, instead of moving as a means to survive you survive as a means of movement. <br><br>There are plenty of possible solutions though. The &quot;carry over&quot; of bats could do part of it - in that case it might become worth it to hang out in the same spot to farm some bats for 2 or 3 cycles. Another way could be to penalize death a bit harder (either just death, or something like dying twice in a row). That we&#039;d have to be careful with though, as we don&#039;t want to penalize players for failing too much. Ideally such a penalty wouldn&#039;t be a penalty that puts you back as much as something that keeps you from progressing too quickly into areas you can&#039;t handle until you have learnt to handle the area you&#039;re in. <br><br>One option we&#039;ve been thinking about is that instead of having the game be one very long session, it could be a couple of smaller sessions, where surviving (or &quot;winning&quot;) a session is rewarded by some more options for your next play. Sort of like how the &quot;rogue-lightes&quot; such as Binding of Isaac and Nuclear Throne and that whole family of games are doing. Like, slightly shorter sessions but accumulation over sessions.<br><br>What do you guys think? Do you prefer games with one long session, or games where you play a bunch of shorter sessions and have something build up over the course of them? <br><br>However it goes, we would like to have the player feel a certain satisfaction after the average successful hunt, when you return to your shelter with enough bats to survive. In a situation like that the player would feel the most as one with the slugcat nature, who is all about eating, sleeping and staying alive. When slugcat is happy, the player should be happy too!

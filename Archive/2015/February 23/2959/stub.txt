But, as there isn&#039;t much interaction with them, the jankyness isn&#039;t game-breaking, so I&#039;ll move on for now.<br><br>I&#039;ve always like the Garbage Worms because they&#039;re weird and because you don&#039;t really interact with them. It adds to the atmosphere when you enter a room and see this weird creature and don&#039;t really know if it&#039;s dangerous - and then you realize that it doesn&#039;t want anything from you, it just wants to live its own weird life in peace. It adds to the lived-in-ness of the world, somehow.<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308151901im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/02/23/QzDpX.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Yup, the animations need to be smoother.

Oddball question here, but what are the odds of you putting up a download for the old alpha? Say, the one from the &quot;slugcat life&quot; video, or whatever it was prior to porting to unity. It may seem odd, but I kinda want to try it out, just to see how far its come. If not, do you think that there will be an option to play the old version in lingo when the game is finally released?<br></div><br>i think we might! probably wont do a big announcement about it, but for people who are interested and can understand that &quot;this is the previous prototype alpha, NOT the actual game&quot;, it would be cool to show how much things have evolved. a lot of the single player in the lingo build is pretty much just a playable mock-up so not terribly exciting, but the mutiplayer is still totally relevant (and fun!)<br><br>one concern is that we kind of dont want streamers to get a hold of it and give people the wrong impression about where we are with the graphics and experience, cuz were light years beyond that now <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308152356im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0">

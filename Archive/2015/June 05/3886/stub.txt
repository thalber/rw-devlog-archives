Thanks tortoiseandcrow for the very well thought through and argued opinion. When you make the comparisons like that I actually get a bit of cold feet. I really do want some dirt and stuff though, and the graffiti was an important world building aspect to me. I wanted to use it to set a tone and to tell little bits about the world, perhaps. Your input makes me realize that I have to think about it more though, I can&#039;t just slap it on top or I risk ruining what I already have.<br><br>Maybe placement could play a part? Maybe it&#039;s preferable for decals (be it dirt or graffiti or rust or other) to be confined to some sort of definable geometrical object rather than existing everywhere as an ambient?<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308160407im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/06/05/2ZjSU.png" alt="" border="0">

i havent been posting because tortiseandcrow keeps making all my points for me XD<br><br>we&#039;ve been discussing this all in depth the past few days and i think a good part of the problem is that the layout and structure of the test room just isnt really suitable for what joar wants to do with the large graffiti. when i did these rooms originally i wasnt taking into consideration the yet-to-be-built decal editor, so i saturated them with interesting visual elements so they could stand on their own. trying to just slap a decal on now isnt going to work, as its just competing for attention with the structure, lighting, effects, depth, tile work, etc etc. Its not the graffiti itself, its how its used in this context that looks off. I think everybody would agree this looks awesome:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308160407im_/https://i.imgur.com/Ye21K3B.gif" alt="" border="0"> <br><br>the obvious solution from my perspective is to work in some new rooms that take into consideration the graffiti visual element so we can nail that look, and then add a bunch of smaller graf element details to surrounding rooms to tie it all together. The suburban region specifically has a lot of re-working to be done, and even an entire sub-region to add, so this is all part of the visual polish plan really! And this doesnt mean &quot;here is a randomly convenient wall for graffiti&quot;, but more just some rooms that aren&#039;t already so visually saturated so we can get the look for the graf elements nice and tight without 30 layers of clutter getting in the way. <br><br><br>We both agree that this is something worth spending some time to fuss with and get right, so considering the rush were in to get an E3 build put together, were thinking that now is probably not the right time to dive too deep into all that. so... TO BE CONTINUED! next posts will be all about boring technical things like getting slugcats to stand on poles better, soooorry

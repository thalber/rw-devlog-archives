Thanks for the feedback guys! The darker palette is because I&#039;m doing a thing where &quot;inside&quot; or &quot;underground&quot; rooms have an alternative darker palette, but I might have gone a bit too far with that. When it comes to how &quot;clean&quot; it is, that&#039;s a weird balance; obviously I want it to be an image of a dirty place, but it should be a <i>visually clean</i> image of a dirty place haha! <br><br>I tried taking your comments into consideration and came up with this, what do you think?<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309211027im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/06/05/Zb9Ls.png" alt="" border="0">

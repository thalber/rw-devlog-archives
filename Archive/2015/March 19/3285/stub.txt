There&#039;s been discussions in the past as to whether or not there should be a visible timer for when the rain comes. I was thinking back to the backdrops of the out door areas, &amp; how you can see the shadows of clouds crawling along the background. Well, why not have the amount of clouds, as well as the rate at which they move, slowly increasing until the entire background is engulfed in the shadow of the coming storm? This could be a subtle but entirely in game visual cue for when the rain is coming(for out door areas anyway). Has this been suggested already?<br></div><br>^ oh yes, thats in already! I wonder if its been shown yet actually? here is a shortened version of what it looks like now: <br><iframe width="640" height="385" src="//web.archive.org/web/20210309161854if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/pQiCzJKlPwU?fs=1&amp;start=" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><br>Cloud cycle becomes more intense, then it gets dark, rumbles, becomes obviously dangerous, then downpour. <br><br>I definitely think we&#039;ll want to improve on that though, especially the &quot;death screen&quot; aspect. Id like to see a more dynamic rain cycle happen, where you actually see some rain in the foreground and background building up while playing, and also some visible back layer fog / wind action. <br><br>this is an obviously super crude mockup i did in 5 minutes compositing stock &quot;rain and fog&quot; video:<br><br><iframe width="640" height="385" src="//web.archive.org/web/20210309161854if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/utkX4cw4LtU?fs=1&amp;start=" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br> <br><br>now think of the two videos combined, plus some foreground rain that fades in and that should give some idea of what im thinking. I mean, the game is called &quot;Rain World&quot;, so we really have to nail the rain dont we? BUT! This is sort of polish pass stuff. We have plenty of nuts and bolts hacking, creature design and level building stuff to get through before were there. <br><br>One thing we&#039;re still SORTA figuring out is how to telegraph the rain cycle death in various nonstandard regions like subterranean, water, aerial, etc. All the ideas are there (a flooding animation, some high winds animation, huge waves, etc etc) but we have yet to actually tackle it, so decisions on any of that might inform how we do the rest.<br><br>Anyway, im starting work on the first dark region called &quot;shadow urban&quot; and REALLY STOKED. The darkness mechanic has potential to be even more significant than the water mechanic IMHO, and im soooo glad it looks and works as well as it does already. PRAISE BE TO JOAR.

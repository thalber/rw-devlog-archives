It&#039;s just kept sort of ambiguous. No-one really knows how much insect and how much machine these things really are after all - as with all RW creatures.<br><br>In other news, I just received the new region from James.

However, simple area-by-area comparison doesn&#039;t nearly do it justice because it has basically only huge rooms, which are denser on the map. The green color is marking 8 screens in suburban vs 8 screens in subterranean, to give you a sense of this. In terms of screens, I&#039;d say that that topmost row (the un-blurred one) is about on par with the entirety of suburban. <br><br>On top of this it is also the most content rich region in the game, with by far the most region specific stuff in it. Exciting!

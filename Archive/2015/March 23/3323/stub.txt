Sorry about it being a bit quiet, I&#039;m doing level editor overhaul!<br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309162000/https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?PHPSESSID=vf70n4td9tnnfum1uj2ularbq1&amp;topic=25183.msg1122546#msg1122546">Quote from: Woodledude on March 22, 2015, 07:52:36 PM</a></div><div class="quote">It seems like anything that conveys the information well is obtrusive, and anything that&#039;s subtle doesn&#039;t convey the information well.<br></div><br>Hahaha this! <br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309162000/https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?PHPSESSID=vf70n4td9tnnfum1uj2ularbq1&amp;topic=25183.msg1122546#msg1122546">Quote from: Woodledude on March 22, 2015, 07:52:36 PM</a></div><div class="quote">The animations could work if there were a little calendar in each of the shelters - Not a piece of ui, but a part of the environment, like a little panel full of rows of LEDs that tell you where you are in the rain season, and how many days are ahead of you.<br></div><br>It&#039;s a very strong theme throughout that the environment was not designed for you, and the intentions and motivations of the architects are completely separate from the intentions and motivations of the protagonist, so I don&#039;t know... The shelters <i>do </i>seem to be specifically a rain shelter though, so it would perhaps make sense. It would become a little bit more explicit than I&#039;d be comfortable with though - it seems so slugcat convenient that people might start hypothesizing that slugcats are actually the architects or something.<br><br>When it comes to stomach growling etc, hahaha, idk, maybe I don&#039;t want the digestive functions of the protagonist to play that big a part in the experience. Hearing constant rumbles and growls from the slugcat intestine would tilt the game stylistically away from the pixelly/cartoony style into something else.<br><br>Between James and me there&#039;s this ongoing discussion, where I tend to think that it&#039;s stylistically cleaner to Accept Defeat and include some UI stuff as long as they&#039;re not on the screen constantly, and James believes in fighting on. Generally we do tend to solve problems if we decide to keep trying, so the fighting on idea makes sense. However I don&#039;t think that the exclusion of UI is worth <i>any </i>price, if it skews the style or mood or has to rely on incredibly forced in-world solutions I&#039;d prefer to just throw some white circles in the corner or something. The jury is still out on this one!

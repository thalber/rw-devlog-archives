Or rather probably more a case of me briefly describing things on a noisy Skype call a few days, and then having a person need to fill 10 minutes of time live on air without much preparation. It&#039;s hard enough to do when you&#039;ve been developing the game for 4 years! Certainly not happy with it, but at the same time it&#039;s not entirely unexpected either. The game is huge and unwieldy, so this is what we get for not presenting it ourselves this time. Anyway, a good lesson to learn. It won&#039;t happen again!

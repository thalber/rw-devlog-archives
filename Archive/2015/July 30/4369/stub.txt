But I never thought that moving &quot;pictures&quot; even 30 at a time could be a problem for nowadays computers. Or is there a difference between pictures/images and textures. Maybe I&#039;m also digging to deep. Just interested. <br></div><br>Yeah I thought so too! Turns out that even in modern 3D games, you usually don&#039;t seem to run that many high-res textures where the color of each pixel down to the 256 color values must be maintained and conveyed - they do other tricks such as repeating the same texture in clever ways by for example re-coloring it. A lot of stuff happens in shaders. When researching this I came across a pretty amazing little community that made an art out of rendering super good looking 3D scenes using only shaders, basically no textures. Either they&#039;d use some little 10*10 noise texture or something, or just generate perlin noise in the GPU. Really cool stuff!<br><br>But yep, moving about 30 (larger than) screen sized pixel perfect textures turned out to be too much for even my modern computer, at least through unity&#039;s rendering pipe line (which I have no reason to believe to be particularly bad) so we had to scrap the parallax effect. Basically everything else that is cool looking in the game since making that decision is based on our current setup (pre rendered screen per screen textures that have the depth coded into them) though , so I&#039;m pretty happy with the trade-off!

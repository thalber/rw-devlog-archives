@Charliecarlo: thanks!! yes for a while it was quasi-randomized, so occasionally you&#039;d get more extreme angles, but now that i am the master of perspective&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308161946im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/cheesy.gif" alt="Cheesy" border="0"> i use it sparingly for effect and keep the angles fairly consistent per region.<br><br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308161946/https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?PHPSESSID=ahlj5jqlvr78cefpl9kd1ofe42&amp;topic=25183.msg1164215#msg1164215">Quote from: Christian on July 30, 2015, 12:46:34 PM</a></div><div class="quote">Hey James, are you still working on areas like this?<br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308161946/https://i.imgur.com/FL81aH7.jpg" target="_blank">http://i.imgur.com/FL81aH7.jpg</a><br>That concept room looked fantastic<br></div><br>most certainly! working on a *huge* one right this moment actually.<br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308161946/https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?PHPSESSID=ahlj5jqlvr78cefpl9kd1ofe42&amp;topic=25183.msg1164220#msg1164220">Quote from: Teod on July 30, 2015, 12:51:57 PM</a></div><div class="quote">The bottom looks like a death trap.

So that room above was a test of using &quot;soft death pits&quot;, where the death is shown either due to the fall or to some gross creature lurking at the bottom. seems to work just fine, so when we get into the polish pass of the levels ill go back and turn every one of the terrestrial off-screen death pits into something like this.<br><br>note: that wont apply to sky regions such as Chimney Canopy and Sky Islands, which are supposed to be very high up<br><br>

parallax was never considered, because a key the look of the game is the forced perspective and vanishing points of the faux 3d terrain and objects. Early into the port from the old programming language, Joar considered using an effect similar to the one above to &quot;snap to&quot; camera points when moving from screen to screen, but it would have made level files literally 30x larger and caused all sorts of other problems for what was essentially just a 1-time &quot;hey coooool&quot; eye candy transition effect, so we dropped it.<br><br>But that said, all of this is perspective is actually in every level screen now, subtly transitionings to other perspectives when going through multi-screen rooms. i just choose how its framed when its rendered to give specific effects to highlight aspects of the gameplay of terrain. <br><br>its pretty hard to communicate this without seeing, so i think even a lot of long time thread readers get thrown off when we talk about it, so let me see if this helps.<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308161946im_/https://i.imgur.com/3082xt7l.png" alt="" border="0"><br>detail: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308161946/https://i.imgur.com/3082xt7.png" target="_blank">https://i.imgur.com/3082xt7.png</a><br><br>notice how you can see the tops of the platforms here, especially the square-ish ones? and the pipes with the grating on the bottom left and right point down and outwards? Thats a top down perspective to highlight the surfaces that you can jump on and set some &quot;im on some tall precarious thing surrounded by a big fall&quot; mood.<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308161946im_/https://i.imgur.com/JPGimVFl.png" alt="" border="0"><br>detail: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308161946/https://i.imgur.com/JPGimVF.png" target="_blank">https://i.imgur.com/JPGimVF.png</a><br><br>here in the bottom part of that room, everything is facing upwards to show scale: &quot;now things are towering above me&quot;. you can see it in those same sorts of grates mid screen, but facing outward and slightly upwards. etc etc. its a subtle thing, but a totally essential aspect of the rain world look. so thats what we talk about with all this 30 layers / diorama / &nbsp;perspective stuff.

James just sent me the updated version of SU and we made a map for it. The new rooms look <b>awesome</b>, and the new geographical layout of the rooms really add to the experience. It feels really cool to be exploring this space and have coherent directions of travel between the rooms. Excited!&nbsp; &nbsp;<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308164108im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/hand-shake-l.gif" alt="Hand Shake Left" border="0"> <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308164108im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/grin.gif" alt="Grin" border="0"> <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308164108im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/hand-shake-r.gif" alt="Hand Shake Right" border="0"> It&#039;s not even possible to express the improvement this region has gone through in just a couple of days.

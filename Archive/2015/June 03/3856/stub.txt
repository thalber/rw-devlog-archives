There&#039;s a lot of tiny little control &amp; level design details that jump out to me, but I don&#039;t want to sully the enthusiasm of this post with things I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll turn your attention to when it&#039;s time to polish gameplay. Even in its current state, this game is exquisite. I&#039;ve been having a lot of fun exploring the world already, and I can only wait in excited anticipation for the next build.<br><br>You&#039;ve got something beautiful on your hands here.<br></div><br>thx thx thx <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308160140im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/tearsofjoy.gif" alt="Tears of Joy" border="0"> we very much appreciate the encouragement! yep, its the alpha (or one of the many many alphas at least). if you bought it a while ago, might be worth using the humble key resender to see if there is a new version up: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308160140/https://www.humblebundle.com/resender" target="_blank">https://www.humblebundle.com/resender</a><br><br>one of the reasons we&#039;ve been pretty quiet about posting pre-order links, etc, is that doing all the customer service stuff associated with it is a HUGE time sink, and we just dont have time to do it properly right now. So sorry if thats a nuisance for anyone!<br><br>that build was done for pax east, so is around 3 months old. i did a playtesting event with it last night (since its still the most stable), and man is it weird to demo old builds! all i wanted to do was show off the buggy new stuff, but alas its not ready for public consumption yet. E3 build is going to be quite a quantum leap of advancement. Joar is on a dev rampage!<br><br>Oh and just to spice things up a *tiny bit* from our boring text posts, Joar did a bunch of new procedural plants recently to give the region flora some diversity. These climbing vines from shadow urban are some of my favorites: <br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308160140im_/https://i.imgur.com/WFIDwTgl.png" alt="" border="0"><br>detail: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308160140/https://i.imgur.com/WFIDwTg.png" target="_blank">https://i.imgur.com/WFIDwTg.png</a>

<b>Update 472</b><br><br>Working on a skin for the big daddy! Not finished yet, but lots of progress today.<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308162747im_/https://giant.gfycat.com/PlainSlightGilamonster.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>First of all, I smoothed the tentacles out with a bezier curve. Bezier curves are actually super easy if you&#039;re familiar with 2D lerping. <br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308162747im_/https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/B%C3%A9zier_3_big.gif/240px-B%C3%A9zier_3_big.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>As you can see from this wikipedia gif, it&#039;s just lerping from one thing to the other, then lerping from that to another lerp point, etc ~ Lots of lerps basically!<br><br>Tentacles still have some issues with vibrating back and forth. That&#039;s not in the skin but in the actual tentacle behavior - however I think I can perhaps solve it in the skin by just checking for repeating positions and ignore them. We&#039;ll see what&#039;s easiest. <br><br>The creature will also get some detail on its body.<br>

<b>Update 440</b><br><br>The waves looked a bit mechanical, so today I added the ability to add &quot;rollback&quot; waves, ie a smaller wave pattern moving in the opposite direction as the main wave pattern. I think it looks a bit better. <br><br>Also I&#039;ve started skinning the new creature. James and I call this critter &quot;Jet Fish&quot; and its specialty is fast swimming. What the head will look like I&#039;m still sketching on, but I&#039;ve started on the lower part used for locomotion.<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309173245im_/https://giant.gfycat.com/VelvetyKaleidoscopicHawk.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>The creature has two strong tadpole-like tails that work together to create an even forward thrust in the water. It&#039;s important to the feeling I&#039;m going for that the speed is even, and these two spiraling tails seem to create a plausible constant swimming motion. When jumping out of the water the creature uses water stored in its body to propel itself upward with a jet, and the two tails are just flexing, probably their muscles help squeezing the water out somehow. <br><br>The actual water coming out should probably look nicer than this, just not sure how to do it. Perhaps a similar technique to the smoke. <br><br>For the upper body I&#039;m not sure yet, I think it&#039;s going to have some pectoral fins as the two tails seem to be way better at pushing forward than they would be at any actual steering.

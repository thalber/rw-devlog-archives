Thanks :D<br><br><b>Question: </b> I&#039;ve started looking at lizard voice now, and want to do something similar to what happened in the lingo version where the animation responds a bit to the audio. Ie I want audio visualization. I&#039;ve been glancing a bit at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309162716/https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/1761" target="_blank">this</a> but it seems to be a bit too unity-specific and seems to utilize the unity UI rather than a code interface. What I want is basically a thing that is hooked up to a unity audio source, and then you can ask it for volume and maybe pitch of the sound it&#039;s playing right now. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309162716/https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/20609" target="_blank">This </a>looks a bit leaner and maybe better, but I&#039;m really wanting for some documentation for these assets - just a list of what methods you can call on them, that sort of stuff. Am I just being stupid for not seeing some button that bring that stuff up or something? There&#039;s gotta be something like what I want in the asset store, but the asset store appears pretty pig in a poke to me - I can&#039;t seem to find much technical details about exactly how the stuff works without buying it. Maybe because they&#039;re written in C# and could pretty much be re-created by any unity user; an explanation of exactly what it does would be giving away the blueprint...?<br><br>Any experienced unity users that have some tips about light-weight, code-based audio visualization? Or just about how the asset store works haha? Jimym GIMBERT?

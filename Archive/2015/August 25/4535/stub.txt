The rope script is decently solid, and uncharacteristically clean/self contained compared to the utter mess my code usually is, so if anyone&#039;s interested in it I can hit you up with the source.<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309162939im_/https://giant.gfycat.com/DefiniteReadyBumblebee.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>This version of the script assumes square tiles and only account for 4 types of corners, up/left, up/right, down/right, down/left - but I think it would be possible to adapt it to work with other types of terrain. You&#039;ll need to run your own collision code for whatever objects are attached at the ends of the rope, but if that code works and makes sure that the ends are not overlapping terrain when the rope gets its update command it should not clip through any corners or anything.<br><br>Working with this I kind of felt the inspiration coming on for some kind of touchscreen puzzle game, but any side projects are like 1200 light years from possible now and for the foreseeable future, so if anyone else is interested I&#039;d be happy to hand it over&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309162939im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0">

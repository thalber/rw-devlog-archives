What if a first-time player discovers one of these right near the end of the rain cycle? I mean, most players might be a bit intimidated by the thing, and avoid it when it starts getting dark. I suppose new playtesters will have to decide if any action should be taken. However, if it is an issue in need of resolution, perhaps they should deactivate somehow when the sun goes down? For instance, the water in the cistern ices over?<br></div><br>i had the idea to have the water level of the cistern visually decrease over the course of the cycle, acting almost as a clock. you can go in and have an easy visual indication of if the gate trip is worth it, or if you need to rush back and find shelter. as the doors are (we assume) powered by the water, the gates simply wont open after a certain point in the rain cycle when the cistern is empty. shelters will generally be nearby though, so while it may be a scramble, it wont be *completely* unfair if you find a near empty/nonfunctional gate.

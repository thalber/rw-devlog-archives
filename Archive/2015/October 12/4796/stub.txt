Thanks so much for your input guys! Will be taken into careful consideration. These game mechanic decisions are mostly going to be in a later phase where we try to balance the game and create a good flow, so there is still some time to figure it out. Maybe we can find some kind of golden balance where we can get a little bit of the goodies from a couple of models.<br><br>Right now it&#039;s kind of silent here because I am doing art for the last region in the game, which we wouldn&#039;t want to spoil! I will however spoil that the mockups James has sent me are looking AMAZING!

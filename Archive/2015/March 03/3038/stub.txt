<b>Update 405</b><br><br>Worked on some tail tufts, and got some more exciting looks for the blues:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308152801im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/03/03/QdH6u.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>I was inspired by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308152801/https://www.google.co.kr/search?q=sea+slug&amp;newwindow=1&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=979&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6Xv1VODSIoTt8gWA04IQ&amp;ved=0CAYQ_AUoAQ" target="_blank">sea slugs </a> and am pretty happy with the result, though it might actually benefit from a little toning down. It becomes a bit too much rio carnival in some specimens haha!<br><br>The pinks are also rocking the occasional tail appendage, though smaller and usually less symmetrical:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308152801im_/https://giant.gfycat.com/KeenUnknownCirriped.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Other than that, I&#039;ve done further individualization of the whites, which was a little bit tricky because everything had to be able to change color.<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308152801im_/https://giant.gfycat.com/ActiveMeekKouprey.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Speaking of carnival, look at this one&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308152801im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/cheesy.gif" alt="Cheesy" border="0"><br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308152801im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/03/03/ek0EU.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>For the evening, the green lizard has picked a wonderful two-row shoulder scale formation, which goes surprisingly well with the spinal ridge! Quite unorthodox! And to top it off, a tail plume. This look is certainly straddling the line of tasteful, but we appreciate the bravery!

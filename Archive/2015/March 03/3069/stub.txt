That&#039;s both a noble goal to have in terms of accessibility and an indicator of good visual clarity and vatiety.

But it&#039;s not entirely easy, if individuals are to be identifiable as well as breeds.

Seriously, looking at all that plumage is making me giddy.<br><br>One issue I&#039;m having is that with the colour variation, some of the pinks look nearly red to me. I don&#039;t know if the reds will look radically different from the pinks, but in any case you might want hedge your bets and adjust the colour ranges of the pinks so that they don&#039;t hit red. Maybe head in the opposite direction on the colour spectrum and range between magenta/purple rather than magenta/red? That way you don&#039;t have quite so much of a problem distinguishing between the two, and red is pretty much exclusive to the really scary one.<br><br>EDIT: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308152943im_/http://s24.postimg.org/5omtatqzp/colours.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br></div>Yeah, there is a lot of space between the purplest hues of the blues and the bluest hues of the pink, but the pinks are sometimes getting way too close to red. I&#039;ve placed them there on the color wheel because I like the warm purples more, they contrast better to the typically cold colors of the background. Another issue is that the human eye&#039;s experience of hue differences doesn&#039;t perfectly line up with the RGB (or rather HSL) model of the computer - some portions of the color wheel we divide into many separate color concepts, while there&#039;s a good fourth or so that we generalize to &quot;blue&quot;. I read some anthropology article somewhere that these divisions are actually heavily influenced by culture - western culture tends to see blue as separate from green, while many other cultures see these as variations of the same color, while being better at identifying the warmer greens. At the end of the day, I can&#039;t really do much more than going by my own eye. When the reds come around the pinks are definitely going to have to scoot over into the colder hues though, unless I come up with some smart workaround. Maybe the lizards could get a secondary color, similar to the vultures right now (vultures actually generate two hue-related colors, you might notice that the feathers are different than the shoulder pads) and create distinction that way.<br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308152943/https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.msg1116705#msg1116705">Quote from: marcgfx on March 03, 2015, 06:04:23 AM</a></div><div class="quote">looks like you are having a lot of fun! I was just wondering if all this extra cool stuff has any impact on performance? are the vultures going to have this sort of attention given to individual looks as well?<br></div>The vultures acutally do have a bit of this, the feathers on the wings, the &quot;danglers&quot; and the colors are all individual. But I&#039;d definitely want to do a bit more. That said, lizards are definitely getting extra attention here, as they&#039;re the primary foe. I can&#039;t spend 5 days on individualization for <i>every </i>species in the game. But I hope for all of them (maybe with the exception of stuff like bats and leeches) to have some degree of it.<br><br>#early access, this is not really my desk as much as James&#039;, but I tend to agree that it&#039;s a different thing with backer early access and public early access. Backers generally have more insight in our development progress, and might be more well-meaning as they understand that it&#039;s a work in progress, and knows what is implemented yet and what is planned to come along, etc. Also I agree that Rain World is probably better experienced as a finished-ish product, I think we&#039;d want to at least have the all of the areas areas and the more important creatures finished before release. <br><br>#pups, as for the name, nothing is concerning me less at the moment hahahaha &nbsp;<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308152943im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/cheesy.gif" alt="Cheesy" border="0"> Remember that the names won&#039;t actually feature in the game, it&#039;s just for the devlog and other conversations about the game. A piece of trivia though, I believe the pups were &quot;pups&quot; before the slugcat was &quot;slugcat.&quot; When it comes to the actual gameplay element, yes sure we do still plan to include them! But as some of you have noted, the environments are quite hostile, so we might want to tone down the escort quests a bit. Perhaps the pups could be made more stationary, so that they generally hang out in a shelter and the challenge is more about bringing them food than about taking them from A to B. We&#039;ll have to see how it develops though.

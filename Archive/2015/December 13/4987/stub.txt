The way the map scrolls and overlays the game is really cool! Maybe it&#039;s more clear when playing the game, but the map is just really confusing to me, It&#039;s hard to connect the game-space places to the map places. My theory is that in the game you recognize locations by the aesthetic details, like chains in a certain way, or specific elements that you don&#039;t find anywhere else, but the map only shows the shape of the platforms. Especially with the big beams that the slugcat is standing on in the screenshot. In the game, they register as one object that you can walk inside, but on the map they look like two beams with some space in the middle, and it&#039;s hard to connect that they are both the same thing (or at least longer than it should).<br></div>Yeah, I&#039;m aware of these issues, it&#039;s not always super easy to recognize the rooms. The idea is that the map shouldn&#039;t really show a perfect depiction of the rooms, but rather a general abstract sense of what kind of routes you can take through the world - it&#039;s mainly supposed to be a route planning tool. If the current setup is in a sort of uncanny valley where you can sort of recognize the rooms but not enough, I&#039;d actually feel more inclined to abstractize the visuals further rather than adding detail. The map is supposed to give a general sense of direction rather than anything else. We&#039;re also very much decided that we want to avoid incentivicing &quot;playing the map&quot;, ie the game phenomena where the map is so useful that players tend to look at it more than the actual game. Rather it should be something you briefly peek at and then get back to the game - James spent a crazy amount of time on those rooms and we want the player looking at them! The map can never reach anything close to that visual fidelity anyways. <br><br><b>Update 496</b><br><br>More map stuff!<br><br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308163922/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/12/13/NSRz7.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308163922im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/12/13/NSRz7.png" alt="" width="500" height="250" border="0"></a><br><br>In order to make the rooms work in their positioning relative to each other, we needed some extra dimension rather than just the 2D plane. As the rooms are already made, retrofitting them into one cohesive world is a tricky thing, especially as some layouts have exteriors and interiors of the same buildings exist as different rooms, and similar situations. <br><br>We contemplated a few solutions to make it work, such as having long shortcut connections that connect to little &quot;mini maps&quot; around the main map. The solution that felt the cleanest however was to just make the map layered - then if two rooms are fighting for the same space they can just be layered on top of each other. Such conflicts occur quite a lot through the regions, for example when many rooms have an open sky and feel like they should all be on the same ground level, or when water levels should be consistent between a bunch of rooms. The layered map is a good solution for many of these problems, as it allows an entire new dimension (sort of, it&#039;s 2 or 3 layers depending on the region) of freedom. <br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308163922im_/https://giant.gfycat.com/MediumHarshBabirusa.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>There are still a few unresolved visual issues, such as how to show inter-layer connections between rooms, but it feels like a solid direction! The sense of space really benefits from the map tool - contrary to just feeling like you&#039;re in an undefined room &quot;somewhere&quot; you get a clear understanding of where you are in the world, which serves the sense of scale.

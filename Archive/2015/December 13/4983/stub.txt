Procedural content is really cool and we&#039;d love to experiment with it in the future! For this game, we&#039;re a bit too perfectionist to let go of control though... Also, I think it&#039;s important to note that it&#039;s not the same as infinite content - the human brain is a powerful pattern finder, and after a while you learn how the algorithms work at which point you have effectually exhausted the content. To extrapolate you could take the example of white static noise - it could be argued to have &quot;infinite combinations&quot; but after a few seconds you have understood how it works; you get the idea.<br><br>That said, the game is largely procedural except from the geographic layout of the rooms. We don&#039;t have a single enemy that is spawned on some trigger when you enter an area - they all move about as independent agents throughout the world, and the combination of creatures that you might come upon when entering a room is completely up to the RNG working through the creatures&#039; AI behaviors. <br><br>Our aspiration is that this will create interesting narratives that will keep the game fresh. As the rooms are static you&#039;ll be able to learn your way around in the world, but what happens to you when moving through those rooms should be new each time!

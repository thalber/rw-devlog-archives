Tanks guys!<br><br>@tanis,<br><br>Here&#039;s an old gif of the tracker in action:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309172824im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2014/08/08/Sx62o.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>some stuff has happened to it since, but the basic principle is the same. Basically each ghost represents a &quot;guess&quot; for where the tracked creature probably is, and the search behavior consists of checking them one by one in order of likeliness.<br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309172824/https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?PHPSESSID=vkbsfuamtteu5ut29k47b5ost4&amp;topic=25183.msg1108820#msg1108820">Quote from: tanis on February 09, 2015, 01:53:39 PM</a></div><div class="quote">While we&#039;re on this topic, how do you let the vulture know that he can drag his body in a certain area because there&#039;s enough room for it?<br></div>It can only path through tiles that are at least one tile removed from any terrain - as you can see in the heatmap thingie.

When fleeing, the lizard considers heading to some place on the map, or heading to the exit. Each of these considerations are weighted with how dangerous they&#039;re considered, and one is chosen. Then the path finder is told to find a path to that destination. When path finding starts, each tile it paths through is asked how dangerous it is, meaning that the threat tracker influences the path finder. The path finder, in turn, may take the creature on one route or another, which influences the Tracker by having the creature see or not see other creatures. The tracker influences the threat tracker ~~~ And each of these steps interact with some other modules as well. Debugging is always a delight.<br><br><b>Update 395</b><br>Cleaning up some vulture stuff, mainly. I&#039;ve been trying to have the vulture picking up the player, and make its way with the player back to its den with the camera following it. I&#039;m getting there, I hope, but there are some problems still. The vulture seems to have trouble actually finding its way to the den once entering a room. My theory is that this is because the room does abstract space path finding even though it&#039;s actually realized... But I don&#039;t know yet.

Is it random or are you taking into consideration the speed and direction of the tracked creature?<br><br><br><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">The behaviors are such tangled messes by now that I rarely have the slightest what&#039;s going on any more</div><br>Eheheh! I soooo understand you there! Been there, done that! :D<br><br><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">When fleeing, the lizard considers heading to some place on the map, or heading to the exit. Each of these considerations are weighted with how dangerous they&#039;re considered, and one is chosen. Then the path finder is told to find a path to that destination. When path finding starts, each tile it paths through is asked how dangerous it is, meaning that the threat tracker influences the path finder. The path finder, in turn, may take the creature on one route or another, which influences the Tracker by having the creature see or not see other creatures. The tracker influences the threat tracker ~~~ And each of these steps interact with some other modules as well.</div><br>How often are you reevaluating the path? I suppose you&#039;re not doing that each frame as it would probably be overkill. Do you do it in the same game loop as the rest of the &quot;brain&quot; of the creature or are you using a different thread for such operations?<br><br></div><br>It starts at where it last saw the creature, and moves in the creatures last seen movement direction. At each division in the path, it creates a copy, meaning that the more the path forks the more copies, which is why an open plane makes it hit the cap right away. Copies that go in directions similar to the last seen direction get a higher score, as well as copies generally closer to the last seen position, and some other factors.<br><br>The path finding algorithm doesn&#039;t really do cycles as in calculating an entire path and then wait a couple of frames - rather it churns along constantly as the game is running, meaning that the creature is following one path as the next is being generated. Path cells have a &quot;generation&quot; parameter, and the creature always follows the newest paths. <br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309172824im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2014/07/07/Ed03H.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309172824/https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?PHPSESSID=vkbsfuamtteu5ut29k47b5ost4&amp;topic=25183.msg1109049#msg1109049">Quote from: Teod on February 10, 2015, 02:42:26 AM</a></div><div class="quote"><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309172824/https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?PHPSESSID=vkbsfuamtteu5ut29k47b5ost4&amp;topic=25183.msg1108643#msg1108643">Quote from: JLJac on February 09, 2015, 06:17:33 AM</a></div><div class="quote">Yeah def! Would probably go under the same framework as lizard infighting, which I haven&#039;t gotten to yet. But it&#039;s a confirmed feature!<br><br>I also had this idea that if you hit the Vulture in the head it could lose its mask, and an unmasked individual would be attacked by other vultures. Still haven&#039;t really decided on that one though.</div>You could do both. Masked Vultures fight not to kill, but to establish dominance: once they understand who&#039;s stronger, the weaker one leaves. Unmasked Vulture is a target they want to kill.<br><br>Although, to be honest, losable mask doesn&#039;t really make a good sense from biology perspective, especially if it brings such serious consequences for the creature. It would be more sensible if it could become cracked, which would make creature lose recognition and force previously established social position to be re-established, forcing more fights between them.<br><br>Alternatively, you could use detachable mask not as much as debuff of the vulture (you lose position in the hierarchy, but you&#039;re not hunted to death), but as a rare item for the player. I imagine it being used to scare other creatures away.<br></div><br>This is a good idea, though I think the subtlety of lethal/non lethal combat between non-player entities might really be lost in the wind. Maybe if they both have masks they could &quot;dance&quot; to establish who gets to scram, but if the mask is off it becomes actual fighting. Buuuuuut this is extra cool stuff, not something to get into when crunching a convention build.<br><br>I sent this mockup to James a while ago:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309172824im_/https://fbcdn-sphotos-h-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpa1/v/t34.0-12/10941319_10205865789189863_4788473_n.jpg?oh=37f8a597afc2672dc2e838b0e67ec4f4&amp;oe=54DD316A&amp;__gda__=1423715829_c3f59977c9cfc0a77dc5407824e29a12" alt="" border="0"><br><br>but I don&#039;t quite know. Sure, it looks pretty cool, but I&#039;m super hesitant to humanize the slugcat further. Wielding the spear already reduces its animal nature quite a lot, and having it actually dress up in little outfits puts the last nail in the anthropomorphism coffin.

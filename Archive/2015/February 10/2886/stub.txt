Wielding the spear already reduces its animal nature quite a lot, and having it actually dress up in little outfits puts the last nail in the anthropomorphism coffin.

It scares other creatures on sight, but they soon realise there&#039;s no vulture attached to it and resume their normal behaviour. It&#039;s not a smart bomb or invincibility shield, but it could be worth dragging one for a few screens to shoo away a particularly recalcitrant lizard. But because it restricts mobility, you probably have to drop it in order to take advantage of its effects.<br><br>In terms of intelligence, the slugcat doesn&#039;t think of it as &quot;wearing a mask&quot; or assuming an identity, just that carrying the object has an effect.<br><br>EDIT: I should post here first instead of on Gaf :D<br></div><br>This is excellent! It gets the point across without turning the game into an equipment game, and it ties in super neatly with the item carrying mechanics already in place. It can also make the mask sufficiently powerful to make the effect clearly noticeable without breaking the game, as it occupies both your hands.

Just a few minutes ago I saw for the first time a vulture catch me in an enclosed area, and carry me outside (with the camera following us through the room exits), take off, and arrive at the place where it had its den. Then stow me in the den and emerge a bit later, taking to the skies again.

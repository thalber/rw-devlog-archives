Valid concern!<br><br>I think that the reason why it looks very busy and overwhelming is that you&#039;re unfamiliar with it. In the context of the game, you will yourself &quot;draw&quot; the map by moving through the region over and over again, so at any given time you should not be presented with more information than you can handle. <br><br>For comparison, when you first enter a region the map won&#039;t look any more impressive/confusing than this:<br><br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309211442/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/12/15/Y08ob.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309211442im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/12/15/Y08ob.png" alt="" width="800" height="400" border="0"></a><br><br>Which should definitely be within what anyone can deal with. From there you build the insane crazy big map yourself by moving around, meaning that you have an actual relationship to all the places shown in the map as you&#039;re guaranteed to have seen them in the actual game before.<br><br>Reducing the map to an abstract node graph crossed my mind, but it has a pretty big downside - if the rooms are not at least to some degree depicted, how do you know which room is which?

eh, its important to note that what you are seeing in these gifs is mockup maps that Joar threw together based on the old (pre-polish) region layout paradigm. We havent even started putting the maps together in a clear manner, so these are intended to show the functionality of the map code (which is AWESOME) rather than examples of the finished product. Further, the map tools allow us to orient the room positions any way we wish, with up to 3 layers of depth if necessary, so im pretty confident that we can find clear solutions. <br><br>its true that any map with be complex though. the world isnt aligned on a 2d plane (and *cant* be), so if a map is to be usable at all, it will have to have depth and 3dimensionality. <br><br>Imagine the Fez map: <br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309211442im_/http://iamericm.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/08/fez-screen-cap1.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>but literally 10x times larger and more complex. AND we need a much higher visual fidelity if we want the map to serve any utility at all. Its a tall order.<br>

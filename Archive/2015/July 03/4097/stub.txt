Shadow Complex&#039;s map was 780 rooms. <br><br>Real question is if the Rain World will be bigger than Knytt Underground (1000+ room)<br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308161138/http://i3.minus.com/iKXxdSAe7YUF2.png" target="_blank">http://i3.minus.com/iKXxdSAe7YUF2.png</a><br></div><br>quick look says we&#039;re near 500, which seems about right pace from current estimations. A couple of these next regions are of a similar sort of scale and structure to Shoreline, so 900ish seems very possible. <br><br>Worth pointing out though that the larger-scale regions are generally much less complex from a terrain standpoint. In a lot of ways, the game layout is such that there are &quot;dense rooms designed for things to happen in&quot; and &quot;transition rooms that give an impression of movement through the world&quot;. So often the time spend in a single screen room will actually be greater than the 4-5 screen room that preceded it. <br><br>Similarly, the conceptual effort that goes into a single-screen room vs what goes into a 10-screen room is roughly the same (tiling and etc takes longer ofc, but thats not nearly as fussy), so whereas i can probably do 3 solid single-screen rooms in a day i could likely do 2 8-screen rooms in that same period of time. so basically what im trying to say is its not the size that counts!!111 er <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308161138im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/blink.gif" alt="Blink" border="0"> <br><br>but that said, this all bodes well for the production rate. Despite being the largest by far Shoreline was also the quickest to complete, and since the next 2 or 3 regions are of a similar sort of structure and scale, im hoping that carries through! if so it could do wonders for our timeline.<br><br>/wonk

What is relevant however is how we implant some patterns that create a half-visible fragment of context throughout the world. The &quot;project what you want&quot; thing is only fun as long as you think that you&#039;re <i>on to something</i>, if you find out that it&#039;s just a grey glop of ambiguity to project your own ideas on you&#039;ll just be very annoyed when you eventually see through that bluff <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309162716/https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0411008/" target="_blank">*hrrrmm*</a> So it&#039;s all about a balance - we will have our ideas about what&#039;s what, but keep it quite blurry, and you&#039;ll be able to map your own understanding on the world and hopefully find some interesting connections between one thing and the other, while never being outright told what&#039;s going on.

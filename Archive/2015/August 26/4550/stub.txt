@Franklins Ghost, thanks! I actually <i>did </i>spend too much time swinging around once I implemented the thing, so I had to remove the player from the development room to be able to continue hahaha :D <br><br>@JobLeonard, yup exactly, when hitting a corner I split the rope in two at that point and then apply the same logic on both the new segments recursively - stepping down in a tree like way until all the intersecting points have been handled. I actually only calculate distance for the points that are inside the sweep area, but what points are inside the sweep area is determined using a triangle/point overlap which calls the line/point distance <i>three </i>times haha &nbsp;<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150831160950im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/cheesy.gif" alt="Cheesy" border="0"> So yeah... <br><br>Working with Rain World has made me become pragmatic rather than idealistic when it comes to optimization - usually all attempts at optimization of stuff like this are utterly soaked by some pathfinding line that is called 14 000 times per frame, outweighing anything that could or couldn&#039;t be done differently in a thing like this astronomically. So I&#039;ve started to gravitate towards writing the easiest, cleanest solution, and then <i>if </i>there is a performance problem optimize it. So far, no problem with performance! Most rooms seem to have less than 100 convex corners anyways, so it blazes through those pretty quickly. If I were to optimize however, I&#039;d take out the tiles that are affected by the sweep and find the corner points in there frame by frame. As most swipes are probably very small and not overlapping any corners that&#039;d likely save some time. For a non-tile based situation like your sketch you could divide the space into sections and only check the points in the affected sections.<br><br>I do think that the convex hull algorithm could be useful as an optimization in a non-tile based scenario, but it would have to be complemented by something, as not every convex vertex is necessarily part of the convex hull:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150831160950im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/08/26/VL5Sc.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>@Christian, no comments&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150831160950im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/whome.gif" alt="Who, Me?" border="0"> Yet&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150831160950im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/whome.gif" alt="Who, Me?" border="0">

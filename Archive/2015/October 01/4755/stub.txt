Yeah I think so too! The maze game is perhaps not quite as strong as the platforming game, but it is suspenseful and fun when there are a few lizards around, and it&#039;s a very welcome change of pace. Suddenly the game becomes way more about planning and thinking rather than quick reflexes.<br><br><b>Update 485</b><br><br>More tile work! This is a little bit more exciting, so I&#039;ll leave it to James to show it off properly in an environment in a couple of days!

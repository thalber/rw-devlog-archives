@Gimym JIMBERT, ah yeah, I do that too! I call it &quot;terrain proximity map&quot; though, which might be a more cumbersome name, idk. Direction? You can get the direction towards/away from any point by just checking the neighbors, right? Or you&#039;re talking about something else?<br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309172748/https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?PHPSESSID=a5pefvk5asmou1oppf61e58a37&amp;topic=25183.msg1105843#msg1105843">Quote from: AxezDNyde on February 02, 2015, 12:47:53 AM</a></div><div class="quote">Well, to me, and I&#039;m sorry for being stupid in advance, this sounds like a simple mapping problem. If your generalNodeList always is a superset of the creatureSpecificNodeList and you are using arrays to store the lists (which I&#039;ve concluded from: &quot;So, all the nodes are sitting in a list, labeled 0, 1, 2 etc.&quot;).<br><br>consider this example:<br>Superset (<b>E</b>xit, <b>D</b>en, <b>B</b>at Hive, <b>S</b>kyway):<br>[ E E D E D B B E S E D S ] ( = globalNodes )<br>And you want to get a reduced set for bats for example like<br>[ E E D E D B B E E D ] ( = creatureSpecificNodes )<br><br>in that case you could just infer the index by just using a mapping of the indices via<br>[ 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 <b>9</b> <b>10</b> ] ( = creatureTypeMapping )<br>so that globalNodes[creatureSpecificIndex] becomes globaNodes[creatureTypeMapping[creatureSpecificIndex]].<br><br>So your functions would look like<br>Node getNode(int creatureSpecificIndex, type creatureType) instead of<br>Node getNode(int globalIndex)<br><br>and based on the creatureType given, you&#039;d use a different creatureTypeMapping array.<br></div> <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309172748im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/shocked.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0"> <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309172748im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/facepalm.gif" alt="Facepalm" border="0"> Thaaaaaat&#039;s how you solve it!

So we&#039;re getting there. Right now I&#039;m struggling with getting the creature to actually follow the path though. Here&#039;s a cautionary tale for children considering game development - this is the stuff you&#039;re gonna deal with!<br><br>The problem is making the creature follow the path into the room from outside it. <br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309172748im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/02/03/SIfhF.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Path finder works goal to start. If the creature is outside of the room, its &quot;path finding position&quot; is moved to the edge of the room (pathfinder needs tiles to work with). Ie the pathfinder works as if the creature is actually in the room. The path moves towards the creature as shown, and when it reaches the edge it goes into the &quot;sky node&quot;. Then the creature tries to follow a path, by looking at all the neighbors of &quot;start&quot;. The only one that has a fresh path is the sky node! So it decides to go up instead of down.<br><br>Hmmm... I&#039;ll figure something out. This looks like it has many potential solutions. The struggle continues.<br>

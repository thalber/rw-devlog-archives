Hm, I don&#039;t know... I think the very expressionistic and emotional stuff is a bit stylistically off-key. The game is rather matter-of-factly in its general tone, the idea is that what happens might be emotional but the presentation is a very straight forward. I generally want to avoid forcing a subjective experience on the player, and from the level work I get the impression that James is on the same page. It&#039;s not like Lion King where there is an Evil Land at the horizon, instead it&#039;s just strange environments fading into each other and it&#039;s up to you how you want to feel about them. The slugcat&#039;s mind should be a little bit of a black box, not because it doesn&#039;t have emotions about what is happening but because if it is a blank slate you will project your <i>own </i>emotions on it. Then there can never be an awkward dichotomy when the game tells you that you should have this or that emotion about something, but you actually experience something else.<br><br>So, if we&#039;re diving in slugcat&#039;s mind I&#039;d be way more comfortable with accessing information in there rather than emotion! But, death star assault map certainly doesn&#039;t sound like what we want either haha! So, maybe information but animal-like information, somehow? As someone pointed out animals have a great spatial sense. I was amazed a few weeks ago when I was babysitting a dog how it was always able to know the direction back home after taking several turns on city streets, way better than I would be. I read somewhere that if you teach a rat a maze, and then change the maze, the rat will still tend towards the coordinate where the food previously was when exploring the new maze, proving that it doesn&#039;t simply memorize an array of lefts and rights, it has a developed concept of space. Humans obviously have a lot of that going as well (if there is road work you aren&#039;t just stopped in your tracks because your memorized order of left and right turns is broken, you find a way around) but in the super artificial environment of this 2D game that sense is definitely impeded and might need some extra enhancement to make it not frustrating. I guess the key question would be what is the minimum that can be done to achieve that? Just a little compass arrow, perhaps? Or a very simple map?<br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309173246/https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?PHPSESSID=t4mmffqeks41pgr81tvb5f8ca3&amp;topic=25183.msg1158905#msg1158905">Quote from: plauk on July 13, 2015, 09:12:49 PM</a></div><div class="quote">I guess I&#039;ll put it this way: I&#039;ll almost certainly need one, and if it isn&#039;t there, I&#039;ll end up downloading a fan-made map and jumping in and out of the game in order to use it... now, how immersion breaking is that?<br></div>A very valid point as well!

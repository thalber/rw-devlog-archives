whooooo yes this region was absolutely brutal to do within the time-frame we had set. ive never worked so hard on something in my entire life, and that is really saying something. it clocks in at 190 screens!! to further Joar&#039;s comparison, suburban was 37 and the next largest region was underhang at 109 T___T<br><br>but the results are pretty pretty good. id say visually its without question the best work we&#039;ve done yet. We&#039;re both dying not being able to show it off to you guys, but believe me its worth the wait to see everything in context. <br><br>Also Joar and I were excitedly talking earlier about all the crazy unexpected / hilarious creature interactions going on. Subterranean spans most of the width of the game map, and as a result it has a good selection of creatures from all the different regions represented, in many cases together for the first time. Its the best example of the &quot;open ecosystem&quot; feeling yet, and requires knowledge of all of the different creatures hunting behaviors in order to have any chance of survival. Unexpected allies emerge, purely through the fallout of the web of predator-prey chaos roiling around you. Its a very cool experience, if you dont mind me saying it.

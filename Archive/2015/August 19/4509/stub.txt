<b>Update 463</b><br><br>Today I made a huuuuuuuuge tile:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150823032336im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/08/19/RGS95.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>This is in another league than any other tile so far. Maybe the largest chimney got close, but that one had basically no complexity - this one is huge <i>and</i> full of details. James will be able to make some really impressive rooms with this one! <br><br>The hollows can be stuffed with custom machinery, which has turned out to look really good in testing. Really looking forward to see what comes of this one!<br>

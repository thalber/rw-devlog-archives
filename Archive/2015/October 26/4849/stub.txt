<b>Update 491</b><br><br>New critter coming up!<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308163509im_/https://giant.gfycat.com/FlickeringHardtofindAtlanticridleyturtle.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>This guy has a bunch of strange quirks. First of all it can see out of both ends, which is why the vision cone visualization is so flickery - easiest technical implementation was just switching every second frame. Don&#039;t worry though, no way to notice this once the vision cone visualization is turned off.<br><br>Then there are a few other things, such as movement based vision (can only see moving targets, as can be seen from the (player specific) vision visualization varying in size with player velocity) and its weird opposite, greatly inhabited vision when <i>it&#039;s </i>moving. It also has hearing, but only when standing still.<br><br>To compensate for this it has that start and stop behavior, where it switches between sensory awareness and movement. Hope for this to turn out an interesting gameplay challenge!<br><br>Behavior and locomotion are wrapping up here, so I expect to get to skinning tomorrow.

Our consensus last time we spoke was that there&#039;d be a normal &quot;new game&quot; option in which the content is <i>less </i>procedural, and then a &quot;new game +&quot; in which the creatures (and other stuff!?) will be more procedural and more difficult. We&#039;ll have to see to what degree this is doable when we get there though.<br><br>@Woodledude oh by all means, don&#039;t keep quiet haha! If I didn&#039;t want to talk to people, why&#039;d I run a devlog? Yep, the idea of a standard fighting style and a breed-specific crossed my mind. Might be worth it to go there, we&#039;ll have to see how much time people actually spend looking at the lizards idle behaviors. Scars are possible, but as you say it&#039;s a bit difficult to map textures to the creatures. Also I don&#039;t know how it&#039;d work with the color restricted art style.<br><br><b>Update 404</b><br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308152801im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/03/02/J9Qvz.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308152801im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/03/02/nYmfK.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>More lizards! New for today is the scaly things with some physics interaction. Also I&#039;m trying to get some breed traits down, right now the pinks tend to have some spikes coming out of their necks, greens has the mohawk, and blues have two lines (horns?) running down their body. All of these traits can of course in rare cases give way to individual variations. Also, please note how the pink up towards the right corner in the second image is <i>fabulous</i>. I&#039;m actually pretty happy with the fact that there&#039;s random strange outputs like that, because I think it&#039;ll increase the narrative quality of the game if there are certain individuals that can be easily recognized.

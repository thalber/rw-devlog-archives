Hahaha lizard infighting is apparently what everyone is here for! I never would&#039;ve known!<br><br>The stuff with different fighting styles in different breeds is viable, but it might be complicated when they have inter-breed scuffles. Like if one tries to wrestle and the other tries to do something else. These behaviors can obviously be given endless polish, and maybe we&#039;ll go there, but not right now. Whites flashing colors at each other is a totally awesome idea though, and really easy, so I&#039;m definitely adding that&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308152801im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/hand-thumbsup-r.gif" alt="Hand Thumbs Up Right" border="0"><br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308152801/https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?PHPSESSID=m748iedsmmq0rmcksb3jhdinm0&amp;topic=25183.msg1116107#msg1116107">Quote from: akryl9296 on March 01, 2015, 04:12:56 AM</a></div><div class="quote">It would self-regulate then, like in nature x)<br></div>Doooooubt it hahahaha! If I have any experience with programmed systems it is that they always do the opposite, ie get stuck in a self-enforcing loop and fly out on a tangent. It could be possible to make it happen if you added a lot of dampers and clampers to basically force everything to be stable, but then you&#039;re not really running a simulation either way, so it&#039;d kind of defeat the purpose.<br><br><b>Update 403</b><br>Working on giving lizards individual traits. It&#039;s difficult, as the most important thing still is that the breeds are easy to tell apart.<br><br>First thing I did was to set up a false bell curve distribution generator. I know that an actual bell curve is the <i>effect </i>of semi-random distribution, but here I&#039;m backwards engineering it - I created a system that made the distributions bell cruve-like. The formula can be skewed to have a varying tendency of distributing towards the edges or bring in the results towards the average:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308152801im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/03/02/JbdH9.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>This is used mainly for random differences in color and size. <br><br>The next step was to map the &quot;spine&quot;, or body mesh, of the lizard. This isn&#039;t so obvious as it might seem, as the lizard isn&#039;t one single mesh but actually consists of a body and a tail, and a head, and there are troublesome transition areas between all of these. After some fussing I got this result:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308152801im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/03/02/lG93r.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>As you can see the system not only maps the points along the &quot;spine&quot;, but also the perpendicular vectors of each point and the &quot;depth-rotation&quot; effect from when the lizard moves around.<br><br>When I got this spine mapping in order, the obvious first thing to do was a ridge of scales/bumps/spikes along the back of the lizard. Later I want to add more stuff, like maybe little tassels on the tips of their tails, or some feathery/scaly appendages sticking out of their shoulders, as well as different stuff that might be attached to the head rather than the body. At this point I have some individual variations looking like this:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308152801im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/03/02/vtk8X.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>I&#039;m happy with where things are headed, and I&#039;m having a lot of fun, but as you can imagine this stuff can soak up an infinite amount of work, so I&#039;m going to have find some point where it&#039;s good enough for now. <br><br>As you can see I&#039;ve already started working a little bit with the balance between individual traits and breed traits. For example the greens are more prone to have a comb of scaly things along their back - the pinks sometimes do, but it&#039;s generally smaller and less colorful. The greens tend to have the more &quot;feathery&quot; appendages, whereas pinks usually have the &quot;spiky&quot; ones, when they do at all. This here sample isn&#039;t the best to show it, but there are some differences in how fat/skinny they are, compare the two leftmost pinks on the second row. There are also differences in head size and tail length/width, but that stuff had to be downplayed quite a lot as it made many individuals look absolutely ridiculous. <br><br>Here&#039;s a better example of skinny and fat specimens:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308152801im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/03/02/2eOPb.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>The fine balance to strike here is to make it so that individuals are recognizable while still keeping the breeds clearly separated. In this sample it&#039;s still visible (I hope) that the green is larger than the pink is larger than the blue, but the line is already becoming hazy - despite the individual differences not being super obvious! Apart from that there&#039;s the challenge of making all of them look <i>good</i>. In a sample of tens of individuals like this it&#039;s easy to be forgiving if one is not so hot, but if you have a minute-long encounter with a single lizard in a room and it looks goofy it&#039;s more problematic. So I&#039;m anticipating it&#039;s going to be a bit difficult. But a lot of fun, for sure&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308152801im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/grin.gif" alt="Grin" border="0">

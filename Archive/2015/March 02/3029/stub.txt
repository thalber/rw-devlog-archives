Yup, there&#039;ll be reds, and yup, I&#039;m a little worried about how to keep the colors apart! Maybe I&#039;ll have to rely more on other features. <br><br>Actually the rotation effects are, in my opinion, strangely <i>more </i>clear in an actual game context. The differences between the individuals also seem to pop more when they&#039;re not all suspended on a grid:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308152801im_/https://giant.gfycat.com/DeafeningWellmadeBaldeagle.gif" alt="" border="0"><br>(this amount of agression between lizards isn&#039;t normal by the way, it&#039;s because I pulled them all into the central room where they ended up in a big pile with a lot of biting, and the general annoyance hasn&#039;t worn of yet as of recording)<br><br>Yeah, blue needs some love still! Wasn&#039;t really thinking about it as &quot;horns&quot; as much as &quot;lines along the body&quot;, sort of like how a chipmunks fur is colored, just that whatever this is connects to the head...

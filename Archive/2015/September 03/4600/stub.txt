@EddieBytes thanks for the input! If I understand correctly I think this is basically what I&#039;m doing, except I can&#039;t just calculate leg positions for the final position, but have to do it continuously along the way to get there as well. The main thing would be points 4 and 5, that&#039;s basically where the difficulty comes in. Please feel free to elaborate if I didn&#039;t understand you properly!<br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308162656/https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?PHPSESSID=or8s25uk7c1kjuulj1gi9gvi65&amp;topic=25183.msg1175653#msg1175653">Quote from: Jimym GIMBERT on September 03, 2015, 09:43:03 AM</a></div><div class="quote"><i>fun to see where the challenge would be </i><br></div> <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308162656im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/cheesy.gif" alt="Cheesy" border="0"> <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308162656im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/cry.gif" alt="Cry" border="0"> <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308162656im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/cheesy.gif" alt="Cheesy" border="0"> <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308162656im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/cry.gif" alt="Cry" border="0"><br><br><b>Update 470</b><br><br>Did some work on the tentacles, trying to get them to properly probe in tunnels without clipping through terrain. Also I have a basic system for dividing tasks between tentacles so that only tentacles not strictly necessary for locomotion are tasked with hunting etc. On a floor it could be pretty cool that the creature in some tense moment abandoned locomotion and collapsed to the floor, using all tentacles to hunt. However, Underhang architecture is all about ceilings and death pits below, and in a context like that it has to be always supporting itself.<br><br>James and I had a quick talk on creature design. As it&#039;s coming along, the daddy long legs has slow body movement, but pretty quick tentacle movement (which can&#039;t easily be turned down because it also uses them for climbing, and then the body would be <i>even </i>slower) and super long range. This means that basically the creature becomes a slow moving little thing with a screen-sized orb of death around it, which is a problem as it will make it practically impossible to move through the rooms.<br><br>We talked a little about this issue and came up with a solution that I think is both gameplay appropriate and pretty cool. The idea is that the daddy is blind, instead it uses hearing and its sense of touch to hunt you. When you collide with the tentacles it will be made aware of you, but not immediately grab you. If it hears something move, it will send a tentacle over there to feel around and check it out. This creates a reason for it to make sense that the creature is basically only long legs - it sits in some corner spreading its legs out throughout the room like a spider&#039;s web, and when something moves through there it tries to grab it and move it towards its center. <br><br>I&#039;ve gotten started on this alternative sensory system by making it blind, but give it hearing (just turning on the hearing module, yay modular AI!) and make it able to &quot;see&quot; creatures that are overlapping its tentacles. Seems to work, but is so far a little unpredictable which is cool because it makes the creature feel alien, but definitely makes it harder to play against. Will need some tweaking.<br><br>Next up is making it able to send a tentacle to check out an unknown sound. This means that tentacles need to be able to switch between three tasks, Locomotion, Hunting and Examination. The tasks should also be prioritized in that order. More visually interesting updates tomorrow!

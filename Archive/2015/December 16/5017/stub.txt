Yeah, there is still a lot of work to do! Maybe I kind of rushed ahead in posting those gifs of the fully revealed map of a fully un-polished region - looking at it again with your eyes it does look very confusing&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309211442im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/whome.gif" alt="Who, Me?" border="0"> These gifs were to show off a technical implementation, not the content of the map, which will make a big difference. A few notes that may address some of your concerns:<br><br>The map will be mostly on a 2D plane - as many of the rooms as possible will be fitted next to each other. The multiple layers will be for some edge cases and the occasional secret passage branching off from a main 2D map. Hopefully this will feel exciting rather than confusing, imagine finding a passage that leads to a little secret area that is &quot;off the map&quot; so to speak.<br><br>The movement of the map in that very short gif is really hard to follow. When you are in control of it yourself it comes across as way less hysterical - especially the layer switching is a looooot easier to understand when you have pushed a button yourself to make it happen.<br><br>Once we have the rooms placed in a sensible manner, the map textures will get a manual touch-up to make them appear more like a cohesive whole rather than a bunch of disconnected little blocks. <br><br>The fog of war really helps to make it understandable. I was showing the map to my dad, and initially he had the same impression as you guys - that it was an overwhelming information overload. Then I tried to turn the fog of war on and move through a few rooms, after which I brought the map up again. He was able to make sense of it because he had seen all the areas I had been running through and could recognize them on the map. This made him change his opinion about it quite a lot!<br><br>As for the complexity, many of the regions are insanely complex! Talking about complexity here, not geographical disconnectedness - the former we want to keep, the latter we want to work with. We&#039;re fans of the complexity and size, it drives home an emotional point about the relentlessness of Rain World and the smallness of the slugcat. The vast size and sprawling nature of the regions is something we think of as a core aspect of the atmosphere of the game. We&#039;d like the map to reflect and visualize that aspect. Which, of course, shouldn&#039;t get in the way of actual playability, so if it does we will definitely take measures to make it easier. <br><br>End of the day, I think it&#039;s pretty hard for any of the parties involved here to judge. James made the rooms, I made the map, and you guys have a 4 second gif of an unfinished chaotic region to look at which you can&#039;t control yourself but which just pans around frantically (my bad!). When we have a player going in fresh in a finished region with fog of war on and uncover it themselves, that would be a better measure of its utility. Depending on the outcome of that scenario we&#039;ll make the necessary edits to have the map be both an artful representation of the world and a useful tool for playing the game. <br><br>As for now, I have to move on to some creature implementation, as map progress can&#039;t really proceed much further until we have some polished regions. But don&#039;t worry guys, we will make the map cool and useful&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309211442im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0"> Not gonna let you down!

Like a color code or a number or something.<br></div><br>Might be a good idea! Mostly I&#039;d like to solve it by having the layer switching not be much of a concern - most of the map should be in layer 1, and when you do go to layer 0 or 2 there should ideally be a chunk of region in that same layer so in most cases you have the relevant information in the same layer displayed by default as you bring the map up. You will of course be able to switch between the layers, but there shouldn&#039;t be a significant amount of browsing between the z-layers. It should not be like flicking through a file cabinet, but rather just the occasional jump in or out to follow one path or another.

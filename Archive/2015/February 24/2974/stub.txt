If everything goes well, it could be a really cool way of reaching people. If there&#039;s some hiccup in the game that makes the streamer lose in some unfair way or something like that, that small little random occurrence could become a big problem. We&#039;d have to be very secure and confident with the stability of the game. And as you also mention, atmospheric exploration is maybe not the best streaming material. That said Rain World does have a zanier side to it when it comes to creature interactions, and that side is further accented in the sandbox mode which will soon come around.<br><br>As for Lingo features, pretty much all of it will make it! Though some things might morph a bit to go with the new and more refined aesthetic. The red bubbles I don&#039;t really know about though, haha... If they make it in they&#039;re going to look quite different!

<b>Update 401</b><br><br>I&#039;m pretty happy today, because I had a bit of a breakthrough in the lizard behavior. As players of the alpha will know, lizards would tend to get stuck at times, especially in corners and tricky geometries involving slopes. <br><br>Here&#039;s a tip for anyone working with A*-following NPCs that tend to get stuck in loops. It&#039;s pretty much a magic fix, and super obvious, so it&#039;s really strange I didn&#039;t think of it earlier! <br><br>Keep a list of the last 10 or so connections selected by the NPC when moving. Every time you&#039;re evaluating which new connection to take, go through the list. If the connection is in there a certain number of times, don&#039;t pick it. If you exclude connections that occur just once you&#039;ll get rid of some options you might actually want, as there are natural situations where a creature might want to turn around and backtrack etc, so I recommend some higher number. I use 2 - if a movement choice has been selected twice or more in the last 10 choices, don&#039;t pick it again. Boom! Now the creature is simply not allowed to make the same choice over and over, it has to vary its behavior. And when it varies its behavior, it&#039;s sooner or later going to have to move away from the problematic area, and can pick up a better path. <br><br>The lizard getting-stuck-ness has been drastically reduced because of this. <br><br>In other news, gamepad support is in and working really well! We have made a build now that&#039;s our PAX candidate, and basically what I&#039;m going to do these last couple of days up until the convention is cosmetics and little fixes to make the experience smoother. <br><br>I&#039;ve been working some with the lizard/vulture interaction, and made it so that the lizards have some fear behavior that can be triggered in some situations. Their fleeing still needs some polish, at times it seems like they just forget that there is a threat haha. But things are definitely getting more refined.<br><br>Most of the stuff I&#039;m doing now is polish rather than addition of new content, so not much in the gif compartment. As a compensation, I&#039;ll give you this truly horrifying situation instead:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308152558im_/https://giant.gfycat.com/ThinSerpentineHypacrosaurus.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Remember, no matter how hopeless it seems, you always have a choice!

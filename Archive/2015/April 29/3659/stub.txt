Yeah, all home brewn shader code! I can post the code if anyone is interested, but it&#039;s fairly contextual to the RW solutions so I don&#039;t know if it is applicable elsewhere.<br><br><b>Update 420</b><br>More mouse stuff! <br><br>Did a little touching up of the charging animation - I wasn&#039;t happy that the entire mouse turned monochrome for a moment, so instead I now have the eyes turn white first so there&#039;s always some color differences going on.<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501011506im_/http://giant.gfycat.com/ImpressionableImpishIchthyostega.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Carrying a mouse as a light source. Seems to work out well!<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501011506im_/http://giant.gfycat.com/PoliteRectangularHarrier.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Also, mice dying <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501011506im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0"> Felt pretty horrible of course, but had to be implemented. A dead mouse will continue glowing for some two minutes, so if you&#039;re <i>that </i>kind of person you can hit it with a spear and get a light source that fades away, but on the other hand won&#039;t run if you drop it.<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501011506im_/http://giant.gfycat.com/DishonestIncredibleCanine.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Other than that, some more boring technical stuff concerning mice existing in a world contrary to just in a single room. They need to be able to do stuff such as determine if a room doesn&#039;t have any dangle positions, and if so move to another room, etc etc. <br><br>If stuck in some pit with nowhere to dangle, they&#039;ll just sit around wait for better times to roll around:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501011506im_/http://giant.gfycat.com/ClosedIllfatedDalmatian.gif" alt="" border="0">

Thanks everyone and welcome to you first timers <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501011511im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0"><br><br>@fall_ark, actually I imagine them as being unable to simply turn the light off - it does get dim when they&#039;re charging, but that&#039;s more because they focus their energy inwards somehow rather than actually muting it. Also, if they could turn their light off to mess with you they wouldn&#039;t be very useful as a light source, making it sort of impossible to progress through the game haha!<br><br>#Facial expressions, thing is that I actually <i>want </i>this thing to be cartoony, I just fail miserably because most creatures are huge gross monstrosities that don&#039;t really have a face at all, or have a solid expressionless face such as the Vulture. So whenever I&#039;m doing a creature where I can actually show of some stylized expressions, I&#039;m really stoked. We&#039;ll have to see, maybe at the end of the day the inconsistency becomes a bit too much and I&#039;ll have to tone it down. But so far I actually like the contrast - it&#039;s not an entirely uncommon trope in comics and anime that some characters (that you&#039;re supposed to identify more with) have stylized expressions, whereas monsters and other mysterious creatures have less stylized faces that are harder to read ~<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; o.0&nbsp; &nbsp; &gt;.&lt;&nbsp; &nbsp; x.x&nbsp; &nbsp; ^.^<br><br><b>Update 421</b><br>Starting to think about assets for the new dark region. This one we had to think quite a lot about, because the darkness has some particular qualities. Basically it&#039;s two conflicting factors. On one hand, the more little details, the better the shadows look. &quot;Porous&quot; tiles with lots of holes and stuff look good in the second layer, because you get to see the shadows move around in them which really displays the volume. <br><br>On the <i>other</i> hand, the darkness makes the level way harder to read. Mostly this is because the darkness breaks up the simple rule the rest of the game follows - dark = close, light = far away. Usually you can look at a room and assume that the dark parts are terrain you&#039;ll collide with, and the light parts are backdrop. The light sources in a dark room however are <i>in</i> the room - and in order for that to work visually I had to make it so that stuff in front of the light source were darkened so that they would look back-lit. This means that with the light source we don&#039;t just have a dark-light gradient, we have a dark-light-dark gradient.<br><br>This works in most cases, but it is admittedly not quite as clear as the ordinary palette. Also, it gets way worse the more little details there are, and the less solid the tiles. Soooo, the same factors that made the light look good. <br><br>My idea for a solution to this is that we&#039;ll be rolling with big, chunky blocks, but on the blocks there are protruding patterns that the shadows can play with. I think this will get both birds with one stone - because the general contours of the blocks are big and square you quickly get an idea of what&#039;s terrain and what&#039;s not, but if you look closer inside those big blocks of color there are smaller variations of shadow play. <br><br>Here are some sketches:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501011511im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/04/30/AWlb6.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br><br>And here&#039;s a &quot;final&quot; (huge quotation marks there, everything always end up hundreds of kilometers away from the &quot;final&quot; sketches) concept:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501011511im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/04/30/2USBl.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Basically the area will consist of of big boxes, that are somehow bolted together with huge clamps. These clamps will run on the exterior of the boxes, and leave shadows. Then the boxes themselves will have a patterned surface, that will also get some shadows going. I&#039;m currently mocking up some tiles, let&#039;s see how it goes!

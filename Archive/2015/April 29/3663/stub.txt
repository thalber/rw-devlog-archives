Thanks for the kind words! Yeah, we&#039;ve really gotten into a good synergy now <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501011511im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0"><br><br>I don&#039;t really think there&#039;s any incentive to kill them, if they&#039;re dead they&#039;ll slowly lose their light whereas if they&#039;re alive they&#039;ll glow forever. It&#039;s maybe a little easier to hit them with a spear than just trying to catch them, but if there are a few of them they&#039;re generally not that hard to catch.

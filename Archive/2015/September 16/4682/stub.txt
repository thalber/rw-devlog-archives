<b>Update 476</b><br><br>And so we&#039;re getting started on the next creature! I&#039;ve made a bunch of sketches today, but I think it&#039;s more fun for you guys to see it develop from the good old red dots, so here we go:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308163009im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/09/16/Sg23W.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>More red dots attached tomorrow!<br><br>In other news, James has been able to assemble the current region, and it&#039;s looking good! This one will be sort of the final stretch in the game, and because of that we&#039;ve decided to go more linear - instead of the standard sprawling rooms it&#039;s supposed to be more of an epic journey where you push through and have to fight for every step along the way. The Daddy Long Legs have proven to put up a bit of a too rough fight though it seems, so that&#039;s going to need a little tuning. James tells me they eat everything and clear the rooms - I haven&#039;t seen it myself but I can certainly believe it! This is standard stuff after getting a region together though, and we&#039;ll be able to sort it out pretty quickly.

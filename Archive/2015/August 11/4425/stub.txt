hey peeps! pardon the quiet, we&#039;ve been putting polish on the Linear Farms region and discussing plans for THE FINAL THREE REGIONS. That and preparing for PAX Prime, where (as usual) Rain World will be showing the newest build at the adult swim games booth. None of which is terribly exciting to post to the devlog about. But we&#039;ll return to the regularly scheduled program shortly!&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309211317im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/gentleman.gif" alt="Gentleman" border="0">

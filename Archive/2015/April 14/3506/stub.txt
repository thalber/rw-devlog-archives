@NicoM, yup most of this stuff is totally learnable if you&#039;re ready to walk through the shadow of the valley of utter frustration :D That said, I <i>do </i>get things to work, but I don&#039;t get them to work smoothly and within slick general frameworks as someone knowing what they&#039;re doing would. So hacking on until you get there is totally a good method if you&#039;re the only programmer on your project, but I think the code that comes out of it would be an issue if you&#039;re many people on the team.

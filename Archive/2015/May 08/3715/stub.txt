<b>Update 424</b><br><br>Working on the gates and cleaning up a bit in the new multi-world infra structure. As every big structural change, it did bring a lot of bugs with it as many parts of the games suddenly find themselves in an unfamiliar environment. For example, I earlier had rooms indexed by their room number within the region, the first one being zero. Under the new system I didn&#039;t like this, as &quot;5&quot; could refer to the fifth number in any of the regions - so I changed the indexing to be spanning over all of the regions, and had the world translate world-general room indexes to region-specific indexes on the fly, causing everything to crash horribly because every place in the code where I was looping over the rooms in a region suddenly referred to some unloaded rooms in the SubUrban region. Well, got that sorted out though, thanks to the search function! <br><br>Other endeavors has included making the script that loads a region able to run over several frames, being kept alive with an Update call, rather than doing it all in one go. This is so that a region can be loaded as the game is running without causing a huge hiccup. I know you should probably use threading for this, but the little research I did in threading scared me away. One article was named &quot;Simple example of threading&quot; and started out &quot;There is no such thing as a simple example of threading.&quot;&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308155358im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/cheesy.gif" alt="Cheesy" border="0"> I&#039;ve never before come across a phenomena in programming that can&#039;t be contained in a neat half-page example... So for now I&#039;ll just split processes over several frames instead. If I do learn how to do multithreading down the line, I assume I can put these split-up processes within the threaded class (if that&#039;s even how it works!?) and just call update on it in a loop till it&#039;s done.<br><br><br><br><br>On spoilers, how do you guys feel? Personally I would prefer to keep blogging, at least to some degree, as the devlog is good for my productivity. At least it feels so - writing down what you have done and have others read it confirms that you actually <i>have </i>done something. On the other hand I can totally see the point of it being a bit boring if every single little detail about the game is already known going into it. <br><br>I guess it depends on what your motivations for reading is? I myself read the Dwarf Fortress devlog, but I don&#039;t really play Dwarf Fortress - the project is more interesting to me conceptually than practically (you&#039;d have to play for years to actually come across most of the phenomena described in the devlog), and with my interests geared like that the devlog is actually a superior medium to experience the project than the game itself. <br><br>On the other hand, a project that is more about the experience either as an action experience or an art experience would probably have way more impact as a game, and the spoiler discussion becomes relevant.<br><br>I can only speculate in what makes RW interesting to you guys, but I think that maybe it&#039;s somewhat in the middle of the two? There&#039;s some conceptual stuff like AI etc that might be interesting to other devs and enthusiasts, but the game is also a lot about the experience of exploration and encountering the unknown. So it&#039;s sort of straddling that line perhaps?<br><br>Let us know what your feelings about spoilers are! Obviously we are going to have a way more open discussion hanging out here than what goes out in the twitter feed etc, but the question is to what extent that should go. We could have a policy that the devlog is cards on the table, and if you want to stay unspoiled it&#039;s your own responsibility to stay away from here. That would make it possible for everyone to custom-tailor their experience, but it brings in a weird element of temptation. Another idea is that we could have a devlog black-out for a month or so, during which we will focus a lot on content creation. That way you&#039;d still be able to follow the development of the game on a conceptual level, but you&#039;d know that when you actually get your hands on it there will be at least some creatures and areas that can surprise you. What do you think?

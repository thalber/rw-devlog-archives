@adge, thanks a lot :D I&#039;ll try to make something inspired by that next time I get around to making assets. The resolution will be a problem so I&#039;ll probably have to go pretty big. We have a region planned with some more tribal stuff, where I think some big columns etc would fit right in.<br><br>@Teod, I think of it as a chemical fire/light emission, similar to when you put flame to magnesium or something. But again, cartoon world&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308160514im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0"><br><br>@tortoiseandcrow, when I implement enemy hearing I will also give their vision some tuning and combine those into a little Stealth Push. Right now vision is entirely binary - for a creature with a limited cone of vision it does that dot product check, some creatures have a distance cap, and then it checks if there&#039;s terrain in the way - but all of these are either YES or NO and it needs all YES&#039;s to get a visual. My idea for what I want to happen in the future is that a bunch of conditions will be considered as floats and combined. Such conditions could be camouflage, muddy water, and darkness. The factors should be able to interact (by multiplication or subtraction) so that you could stay hidden more easily if you&#039;re smart about it. <br>

Remember this?<br><br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308160438/http://oi41.tinypic.com/af9h1h.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308160438im_/http://oi41.tinypic.com/af9h1h.jpg" alt="" width="512" height="384" border="0"></a><br><br>Don&#039;t really know, the mayan stuff was pretty cool but doing a switch would mean replacing a looooooot of assets. I think James&#039; enthusiasm would be curbed&nbsp; by the outlook of having to re-render every room with a neon sign in it (which amounts to... every room) &gt;__&lt;<br><br>I already have two fictional alphabets going, and I absolutely won&#039;t introduce a third without cutting one or both of the old ones out. They <i>were</i> however made sort of quickly, a long time ago, for a game I imagined would be a month long side project... So maybe it is actually time to switch them up. It wouldn&#039;t need to be too harrowing, as I could just replace the neon sign assets but have the same names for them, and then they&#039;ll be naturally replaced as the rooms are re-rendered for touchups without us really having to do anything manually. That assumes that we&#039;ll re-render every room at least once more, which I think is probably the case. Otherwise there&#039;s a mass render function in the editor. So, it&#039;d be annoying, but it&#039;s not entirely out.<br><br>Here are the current two alphabets:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308160438im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/06/07/jymTL.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>And here&#039;s a piece of graffiti with the letters clarified:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308160438im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/06/07/wtjvL.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>One thing I could do to get a tribal/mayan vibe going without replacing the alphabets, is to work more with the pictographical &quot;proto-comic&quot; sort of layout many ancient cultures seem to have employed. Like, images that are in some sort of chronological sequence with small bits of text flowing in and out of it. That could be really interesting to mix up with a graffiti aesthetic!

Joar has mentioned the palette fades a few times, so i figured its time to show a bit of whats going on with that. this is a first pass at the transition into the shadow urban region:<br><br><br><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="640" height="385" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308160438if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/s9HUo71PQlk?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><br>this example could still use some work to the blends, the sunlit rooms could use to be toned down a bit (there is a whole little subregion devoted to that look), but it seems like the palette toolset is going to have a big impact! in polish phase i plan on going back and adding subtle touches of this through all the regions to indicate things like depth/height, inside/outside, and blend the palette transitions between the regions a little. im really looking forward to it!<br><br><br>edit: ehhhh, youtube image compression is totally borking the fades and introducing weird colors / artifacts. they are WAYYYY more subtle than that in game. but you get the idea.

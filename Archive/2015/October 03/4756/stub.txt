GOING DEEP!<br><br>Past week or so we&#039;ve been working on materials and structure for the 11th (and penultimate) region on our to-do list: Subterranean! Probably won&#039;t get into too much detail with the specifics of it since its among the final regions the player will encounter, but suffice to say that its underground, so totally happy to show off some of the deep cave-like elements we&#039;ve been messing with for the top layer subregion. <br><br>Joar has whipped up a *fantastic* new (procedural?) dirt tile material and a pair of dark-ish cave palettes to get us going. Worth noting is that we spent a few days fretting on how to make these work, as both aspects are potentially a bit of a departure from how things have been done so far, but i think it came out really well:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309163406im_/https://i.imgur.com/h5HW5Jx.png?1" alt="" border="0"><br><br>detail: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309163406/https://i.imgur.com/8wndxmd.png" target="_blank">http://i.imgur.com/8wndxmd.png</a><br><br>This sub-region is &quot;Near Surface Subterranean&quot;, so occasionally you come across areas where the cave ceiling has given way and shafts of saturated light shine down, illuminating the walls. So we needed a palette that would work with various lighting types and could also be blended with other &quot;outside&quot; palettes for when transitioning to other surface regions. No easy trick, and Joar did an amazing job! I know its subtle stuff, but definitely worth pointing out as I think its the best palette work in the game so far. Here is the same palette, but deeper underground and with only player lighting:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309163406im_/https://i.imgur.com/SFwCDX9.png?1" alt="" border="0"><br><br>detail: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309163406/https://i.imgur.com/gyl3kYY.png" target="_blank">http://i.imgur.com/gyl3kYY.png</a><br><br><br><br>experimentations continue... so more soon!

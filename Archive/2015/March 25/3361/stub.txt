@Tiredvd, Hi, welcome! Okay, I&#039;ll try to clarify. You know the basic laws of perspective, right? Lines converge at the horizon. Imagine standing on a street, pointing a camera down the road and shooting a picture. Then you take ten crab-steps strafing to the left, and shoot another picture.<br><br>Each screen in our game is such a &quot;photo&quot; of a small voxel-based 3D world. The reason why we can&#039;t just put one next to the other and scroll between them is because the perspective is different. In the camera example, imagine trying to combine the two photos into a panorama. It wouldn&#039;t work, because everything in the photo will have moved a <i>different</i> amount depending on its distance from the camera. The lamp post right in front of you will have moved all over the picture from one end to the other. The tree two blocks down will have just inched a tiny bit to the right. And the same phenomena applies to every single point in the picture. The perspectives are not&nbsp; compatible.<br><br>This shows the overlapping area between two &quot;screens&quot; in a room from the game. Note that in the middle, you see the same structure, but it&#039;s rendered at different angles because the perspective is different.<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309162242im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/03/25/damsO.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>This is the reason why not several screens can be attached to each other to create a scrolling continuum. <br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309162242/https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?PHPSESSID=8lv2g3k7kc0n0hmrsc4726qs13&amp;topic=25183.msg1123170#msg1123170">Quote from: Tiredvd on March 25, 2015, 02:40:42 AM</a></div><div class="quote">Also just to highlight a valid point that Torchkas raised earlier, that I feel you might have missed.<br></div><br>Totally didn&#039;t miss that, just hoped for it to pass under the radar&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309162242im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/cheesy.gif" alt="Cheesy" border="0"><br><br>#bubbles, if the bubbles change their appearance a lot to show different states of the slugcat, that sort of takes them beyond the point where they&#039;d make any sort of physical sense, and don&#039;t we just have ordinary good old HUD then, but presented in a slightly different way?<br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309162242/https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?PHPSESSID=8lv2g3k7kc0n0hmrsc4726qs13&amp;topic=25183.msg1123214#msg1123214">Quote from: Teod on March 25, 2015, 04:37:22 AM</a></div><div class="quote"> Another way of showing the character state would be the closeup that can be shown at the beginning of every cycle. Imagine level of detail similar to the logo artwork, maybe even with some animation, that shows the state of the character.<br></div><br>I&#039;m really into this idea!&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309162242im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/grin.gif" alt="Grin" border="0"> This provides a perfect opportunity to get to know your character a little more intimately than just as a tiny cluster of pixels on the screen! I&#039;ve wanted to include more artwork in the game for a long time, but because of the minimalist UI etc I haven&#039;t really seen any opportunity - but this is it! While being in the den you are sort of half in-game, half not, so it&#039;s the perfect context to include something like this. A little could go far with this I think - just some illustrations of the slugcat sleeping in the shelter as a &quot;win screen&quot;, maybe with the pups if you have any, would really add a lot of narrative quality to the game without really intruding on the actual game, because in the den you&#039;re half out of the game anyways!<br><br>Oh man oh man so much cool stuff! On cycle start, there could be some events that could happen, communicated through pictures. For example that one of the pups is sick or starved. Maybe the cycle starts with a black screen where you can see an illustration of each member of your little pack waking up. Under each illustration is a row of bat symbols (which is okay, because this is not a HUD overlaying the game, this is just the cycle&#039;s establishing screen!) and if one individual is sick or starved or something that&#039;s communicated through the illustration and reflected in that they need a few more bats. Then the intro screen fades out, and you start playing in the shelter!<br><br>I&#039;m really enthusiastic about this <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309162242im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/whome.gif" alt="Who, Me?" border="0"> Gotta see what James has to say though, and run it through some discussions with him to see if it holds up, but I&#039;m digging it!

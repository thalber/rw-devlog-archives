That would allow the &quot;walls floor and ceiling&quot; to still show at the edges. Lots of traditional 2D animation backgrounds work like this, as do the side-scrolling painted backgrounds in fighting games, eg:<br></div><br>This is how we&#039;re going to have to do it for split screen and some platforms with smaller screens (when the viewport is smaller than an in game &quot;screen&quot; we&#039;ll have to scroll stuff around within that camera position), and I&#039;m sure it&#039;ll work out okay. Doing it for multi-screen rooms becomes problematic though, because at the edges stuff becomes so skewed you lose your player avatar behind extruding terrain. The alternative is to have the edges always be the same amount of skew, but in that case the central screens become completely flat. Unity has a texture size cap that&#039;s way below the rooms sizes we want as well - and the room textures are actually pretty large memory wise.<br><br>oblique projection, yeah, totally considered it. It would open up some technical possibilities for sure. Actually the level editor can spit these out super easily, just have to change a few lines of code:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309162242im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/03/25/JP5b6.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>It has benefits, the rooms might be a little easier to read visually. But it&#039;s less aesthetically interesting according to me, because you only get either the lit or the shaded sides of each surface, which makes the image look flatter and gives less room for visual contrast. Also it looks more technical and video-gamey rather than the wonky and slightly unsettling perspective. It&#039;s an art style choice, I guess!

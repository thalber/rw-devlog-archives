<b>Update 450</b><br><br>Big sea monster under construction!<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309162716im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/07/07/jkPQn.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>This scene is actually under water as you can see from the floating slugcat, but I turned the water sprite off to see what I&#039;m doing. <br><br>My inspiration for this thing is that fear you get from seaweed when swimming - the fact that it&#039;s a lot of floating flaps in constant movement makes you uneasy because you can&#039;t tell what&#039;s what. The idea is that this thing, partially obscured by the water shader, will cause the same sort of discomfort, combined with the fact that it&#039;s huge. Tail and all it&#039;s about two screens long!<br><br>As of now it&#039;s not as dangerous as it&#039;s scary (not that it can even grab you at all, but just from testing whether it&#039;s able to move up to me and boop me with its head) so it might need some sort of extending mouth parts to make it live up to its appearance.<br><br>For the behavior I have several things I haven&#039;t decided on yet, such as if it will hunt you near the surface or not. On one hand it would be cool if it never came up to where you could see it clearly, because if you never get a good view of it it will remain ominous. But it&#039;s really cool when it breaks the surface and creates a bunch of waves as well, so idk!<br><br>

It&#039;s really hard to not give stuff away, I&#039;m so used to communicating with you guys! The last thing I will say is that Chris is on to something - light provides safety only momentarily. <br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308155639/https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.msg1141150#msg1141150">Quote from: TheWing on May 20, 2015, 04:24:36 AM</a></div><div class="quote">The world seems to share similiar elements to Nifflas&#039; Knytt: Underground, but gameplay is very different. And the world feels way more alive due to all the moving stuff, ad the way platforming is smooth and fluid :3<br></div><br>Thanks and welcome! Yeah I&#039;m also a big fan of Nifflas stuff, used to play a lot of Knytt back in the day. What&#039;s really fascinating to me about those games is how effectively exploration is used to propel the player - if I remember correctly most of the games had some collectibles scattered that sort of motivated you going all over, but those were really secondary, mostly you just kept going because you wanted to see more. And it was pretty much only about the environments, the enemies were simple and few. If I remember correctly there was one or two of the games where the enemy/danger aspect was toned down almost to zero, the game was only about the joy of exploration and some light platforming challenges. It&#039;s pretty awesome how a lot of hand-made rooms can acquire that degree of value or &quot;aura&quot; just by you having to move between them and explore them. If you had screenshots of all the rooms in a folder you&#039;d just flick through them pretty indifferently, but because you had to find them yourself in this huge sprawling world they each felt like a <i>discovery</i>. <br><br>Rain World is not as conceptually tight as those games though, it can&#039;t as easily be reduced to a core like that as it has lots of other stuff going on as well (AI, emergent interactions) for better and for worse. But we&#039;d definitely like to harness some of that joy of exploration from the Knytt games if possible! And I think James has been doing an awesome job so far in making each room unique while still tied to its region, which is in turn stylistically tied to the game&#039;s general atmosphere as a whole. If we could pull off the stunt of having Knytt-style joy of exploration and then add the AI stuff etc on top, I would be really happy!<br><br>In progress news, I finished up creature X to the degree that it works in a connected world, reacts properly to the rain cycle, etc. Which is more than what can be said about some of the other &quot;finished&quot; creatures haha&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308155639im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/cry.gif" alt="Cry" border="0"> Garbage worms still don&#039;t have a solid functionality for placement in the world, for example. But I&#039;ll get to it! In the mean time, I&#039;m doing some sound stuff that James has been asking for - fixing a few errant sound triggers, adding in new sound triggers, etc. The next big challenge is water sounds, that&#039;s going to be a big one! Either it proves easier than expected, and just firing off random somewhat-contextual watery sounds will blend together and work really well, or, well, we&#039;re in for a ride!

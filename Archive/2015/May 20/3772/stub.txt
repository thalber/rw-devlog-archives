Oh, really cool! I wouldn&#039;t really sweat it either though. The description sounded a bit similar, but the visual style and setting reminds much more of Limbo, and the gameplay seems quite different as well - more like a fighting/action game where the characters are large on the screen and geometries that are floor-oriented rather than maze like. <br><br>Also, there&#039;s a lot of room for good stuff <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308155639im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0"> I obviously design stuff in RW as I do because I like it that way, so when someone else is doing something similar I generally tend to like that as well haha! I wouldn&#039;t suggest that actual game makers that have actual releases in their belts are taking inspiration from me, but I really do like procedural animation and one of my aspirations for this project is that more people will get into that sort of stuff ~ So if it&#039;s already getting more common I&#039;m stoked. Hopefully in 5 years the term &quot;game animation&quot; will naturally refer to the creation of body movements that are deeply tied to AI and environmental context, rather than just cartoon animation put on top of a moving block. Every step in that direction is exciting!

SFX seemed like the obvious way to start out, so thats in now, but we are also looking to have dynamic systems for both atmospheric (ambient / weather audio) and music. atmospheric is probably next on the list, and although the music is hugely important from my perspective, i think the implementation of that aspect will wait until the narrative elements are in place and we can have that all work together tightly. <br><br>it should be mentioned that im going way, waay, waaaay over the top for the audio stuff. as i see it, its unlikely ill be in a position to be this impractical with depth of content and level of detail again, so im going all out.

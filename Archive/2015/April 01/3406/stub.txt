Haha yeah &nbsp;<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308153619im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/cheesy.gif" alt="Cheesy" border="0"> The real art James comes up with will probably look a lot different though.<br><br><b>Update 410</b><br><br>Sorry about it being a bit quiet! James and I have had several long talks about the direction of the game, and have decided on some pretty fundamental changes.<br><br>The big change is about the slugcats offensive abilities. We definitely felt that the game was lacking something, and it took us a while to figure out what. However, we came up with some ideas, and I&#039;ve started on some basic implementations:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308153619im_/https://giant.gfycat.com/PoorCaringGuanaco.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Not really done yet, I want to add some flying shells as well, but I&#039;m really happy about the lighting effects &nbsp;<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308153619im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0"> Obviously there should be sparks on impact as well, but I need to get some basic infra structure for the bullet physics down first.<br><br>Other than rocks and spears, we want to expand the slugcat arsenal in order to give the gameplay more variety. We want the new equipment to work with the world, so instead of just adding standard weaponry we have some ideas that are more in line. I don&#039;t want to give too much away, but other than this (admittedly fairly standard) machine gun, we want some sort of weapon that shoots spears as well - basically a spear bazooka. I&#039;ve also made a few sketches of a rock grenade, basically a bomb that shoots rocks in all directions upon detonating.<br><br>This is really gonna change things up &nbsp;<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308153619im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/shocked.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0"> Will be super interesting to see how these new pieces interact with the existing enemies. In order to make the enemies challenging, we will probably have to equip some or most of them with new offensive capabilities as well. I&#039;d like for the lizards to have head-mounted machine guns, but we&#039;ll see what works. <br><br>Lot&#039;s of exciting stuff coming up!

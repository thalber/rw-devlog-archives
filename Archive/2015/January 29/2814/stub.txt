<b>Update 389</b><br>Today I&#039;ve been doing two things, but neither really to a place where I have much to show, sorry! First one is that I&#039;ve started on the &quot;sky highway&quot; - a way for flying creatures to teleport between rooms. The first step was to identify the room borders, which is now done - next step is going to be having the abstract world map understand these room exits as Nodes, similarly to exits and dens. This is a journey through the absolutely murkiest parts of the rain world engine - the stuff that has to do with path finding, AI prebaking and interaction between the game and the level text files, so it&#039;s gonna be trouble for sure. But maybe it&#039;s as well that I go in there and renew my understanding of how that stuff works, or I might forget it completely.<br><br>The other thing is tiles! For once I want to have some margin, and do the tiles for the next area before James is already halfway through it, so I&#039;ve gotten started on that.

Hi everyone!<br><br>So, on the subject of the devlog thing we talked about earlier, I&#039;m making a creature that I&#039;d rather keep silent about as I think you guys will want to discover it yourself. It&#039;s a darkness dweller, and it&#039;s REALLY scary, so I wouldn&#039;t want to spoil that for you <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308155515im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0"> Estimate to be done tomorrow or the day after!

<b>Update 416</b><br><br>Gotten started on audio implementation. I have a pretty solid idea about how to do it now, I think. I have a text file where all the sound triggers are named, and then you can put down the name of the sample to be played at that trigger. This means that I can just set up the triggers and then send it over to James for him to actually work out what samples should go where, and tune them entirely on his end.<br><br>Under the hood I have a system where each sound trigger is represented in a enum, and the enum can be cast into an int which refers to a position in a list where the sound to be played is. I use this system because I think we&#039;ll be playing a lot of little sounds, and I don&#039;t want to have the code repeat through any sort of list to look for samples. This way, the trigger inherently holds the &quot;address&quot; to the correct sample, and the sound engine can just go and fetch it. From my understanding this doesn&#039;t do any implicit repeats through lists after compilation, as the enum-int transition is just about changing the data type of a variable.<br><br>I have some sounds playing, and a basic sound engine working already. I can play a &quot;disembodied&quot; sound which comes from anywhere and has a set pan/volume, and now I&#039;m working on sounds that are played within the actual world and which are tied to a &quot;Virtual Microphone&quot;, which has a position within the game world and changes the volume/pan according to the sound sources&#039; relative position to it.<br><br>Things are moving along well enough! The only problem I have so far is that Unity&#039;s volume control for samples seems really weird. Between 10% and 100% volume I can barely hear any difference, and pretty much the entire scale is squeezed together between 0% and 10%. I can sort of hack around this problem by just doing a Pow operation on the volume with an exponent of 3 or something, but it puzzles me. Does anyone know anything about this?&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308154549im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/whome.gif" alt="Who, Me?" border="0"><br><br>

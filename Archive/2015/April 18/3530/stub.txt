ahh thanks so much for the kind words! im really heartened that example wasn&#039;t considered &quot;too out there&quot;, as that was a definite concern. we&#039;re both doing this as an art project and exploring some pretty weird techniques, but its equally important to have that not get in the way of communicating the mood of the game to a person experiencing it. like, sure its clever that i did that track from a 3 second junk audio clip, but... it also has to actually &quot;work&quot;.<br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308154738/https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?PHPSESSID=fomlg6prgi3ib3amjvchtlecr0&amp;topic=25183.msg1130326#msg1130326">Quote from: Torchkas on April 17, 2015, 01:05:48 AM</a></div><div class="quote">Holy shit that&#039;s a million times better than the track posted on the first page.

Its been a strange experience, since most of the tracks associated with the game were done years ago on a lark for what I assumed would be just a little free game. Things have progressed considerably since then, but also I have a lot of comments from people / backers who really like the original tunes, so I&#039;d feel guilty completely scrapping them. They don&#039;t really fit the narrative aspect of the current game so i dont think i&#039;d want them in the single player, but what I might do is have them as tracks available in multiplayer? Then they would be there for people who like them, but it doesn&#039;t derail the atmosphere.<br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308154738/https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?PHPSESSID=fomlg6prgi3ib3amjvchtlecr0&amp;topic=25183.msg1130328#msg1130328">Quote from: Prinsessa on April 17, 2015, 01:16:40 AM</a></div><div class="quote">Wondering if it shouldn&#039;t be mixed with some very simple, non-intrusive &quot;music&quot;/instrument in the background sometimes as well or it might get tedious after a while.<br></div><br>Yep, totally. This relates to the dynamic audio question as well. The way I have it organized is that there are 3 layers of non-sfx audio, each specific to an individual region: one layer to set the ambiance of a room/sub-region/etc, such as dripping water or machines rumbling softly; another layer that relates dynamically to the weather, so wind, light rain, atmospheric stuff; and the third is tied to narrative elements, game objects or specific moods we want to convey, and that is generally &quot;music&quot; but can also be &quot;music-ish&quot;.<br><br>the idea is that as you move through the environment, regions, rooms, etc., there is a kind of constantly shifting, blending soundscape around you, and you would rarely (or potentially never) hear the same blend of sounds again. thats the idea at least! all the pieces are there, we just have yet to implement it. <br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308154738/https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?PHPSESSID=fomlg6prgi3ib3amjvchtlecr0&amp;topic=25183.msg1130377#msg1130377">Quote from: Christian on April 17, 2015, 05:10:11 AM</a></div><div class="quote">Also, &quot;huge creature&quot;...hmm, just an example or a hint of things to come?<br></div><br>&nbsp;<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308154738im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0"> <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308154738im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0"> <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308154738im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0"><br><br>Anyway, audio stuff is on pause for a day while poor Joar sorts through some bat audio triggers and wraps up the FINAL editor update (fingers crossed!), so I&#039;ve been putting together concepts for the next region: Garbage Wastes!

I&#039;ve been looking forward to this one for a loooooooong time, so its great to get down to business. <br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308154738im_/https://i.imgur.com/RRwvXUZl.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308154738im_/https://i.imgur.com/BBElyKCl.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br><br>This region was also, if i remember correctly, one of the major reasons for Joar building the prop editor, so I&#039;m starting to play with that a bit in context and DAMN it is going to add so much! There is serious potential for over use of it to ruin or at lest significantly change the already established aesthetic, so I&#039;m starting slow. In the above room for instance, the boxes and some sticking up curved beams are the only prop additions.

I&#039;ll let him tell you all about the decals and props and draped cables, but suffice to say, it its going to add a ton of polish visually and should take us through to the end. <br><br>It&#039;s an insanely huge addition to my level toolkit because previously any visual concepts I wanted to have in a room, &quot;the look&quot;, had to be completely done within the 3 layers of playable geometry, and MAAAAAAAn is that limiting! Now I can say &quot;hey I want a fan tile here&quot; and not have to make it work with the physical/spatial orientation of the room. Also, whereas the physical tiles can only be placed in 3 layers of groupings (0-10, 10-20, 20-30), the prop tiles can be placed at any depth from 0-30, meaning I have much more control of the perception of depth, which will make for a more nuanced look and expanded Three-dimensionality.<br><br>Anyway enough blurb, Imma get to it!

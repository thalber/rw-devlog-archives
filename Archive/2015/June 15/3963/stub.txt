<b>Update 437</b><br><br>Working on lizard hearing. It seems to be making the game pretty brutal, but it also opens up for more fun sneaking scenarios such as throwing a rock to trick the lizard into thinking you&#039;re somewhere you&#039;re not, and of course crouching and being tactical about your jumps.<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308160648im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/06/15/tneDR.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Currently I have a system where the creature&#039;s noise detection ties in with the already established visual tracker. When it hears a sound it will go through the creatures it knows to be in the room, and tribute the sound whichever memory of a creature is closest to the sound source. Then it will update its perception of the creature to that new spot. A fun scenario this system supports is a lizard that has fled from a vulture but hasn&#039;t seen that you are in the room - if you make a bunch of noise without showing yourself it will assume it&#039;s the vulture and flee from you haha.<br><br>Next step is having a little &quot;go check out what made that sound&quot; behavior for situations where the creature does not have any idea what might have made the sound, such as the standard stealth game situation where you throw a rock to have a stationary NPC go investigate and move out of your way. <br><br>Also I&#039;m going to need to work a bit with the lizard animation to attempt to communicate when the lizard has picked up a sound. That&#039;s going to be a fun challenge haha!

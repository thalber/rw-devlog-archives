It&#039;s kinda hard to find a specific one. It would be infinitely more helpful if it had&nbsp; at least a date in the title, let alone a proper name.<br></div><br>The 151222 in the title is the date actually: 2015, Dec 22. It relates to the build version that we are working with. I def see your point, but until the builds are where we want them to be (i.e. done) is prefer the alpha /beta videos to be hard to find. You&#039;ll notice that all of the videos are set to &quot;unlisted&quot; as well for this very reason. We&#039;re close, but not there yet! When it&#039;s properly finished I want to to some proper flashy vids to hype and don&#039;t want people seeing footage from &quot;random alpha build version 7485737&quot; when they search for it.

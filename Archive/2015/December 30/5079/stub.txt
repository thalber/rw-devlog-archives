The main problem is a technical one that has to do with path finding. The entire room is covered in a system of invisible &quot;connections&quot;, and each movement requires a connection. So for example, every place where you can drop from a pole to a floor below it has &quot;drop connections&quot; between the corresponding tiles. <br><br>For this reason, basically no creature in Rain World except from you (who is player controlled, not path finder controlled) can jump. Many can fly, which is no problem because it&#039;s just a matter of following &quot;neighbor connections&quot; between the air tiles, and a few can sort of lounge along the ground, but no proper jumps. Gliding would go into that same territory of the jumps, where the problem is that each starting point has a potential infinite destination points on the map. Mapping that out would take super long, and then memory would get really bogged down with all the connections that are barely every used, slowing down the pathing. The other big issue is getting the creature to actually end up on the destination position, which is quite difficult when you have several seconds moving through the air with the super chaotic physics of several body parts pulling at each other in all sorts of directions.<br><br>So, as it stands I don&#039;t know how realistic gliding would be. Potentially it could be added as a thing that is sort of outside the path finder - so they wouldn&#039;t be able to actually figure out a path including a glide or jump, but in an action situation they might be able to identify a jump or glide opportunity and go for it, for better or worse. I&#039;ll have to ponder on it a bit! As the gliding would be sort of a secondary ability, I&#039;ve focused on getting them to work without it first, and then the potential to add it in later will always be there.

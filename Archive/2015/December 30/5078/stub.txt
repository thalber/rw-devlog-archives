<b>Update 501</b><br><br>Scavenger climb behavior!<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308164440im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/12/30/a7UYs.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>They can switch between an arm walk and just climbing along the pipes. The one where they cling close to the pipes is fairly standard Rain World animation - they basically just swoop along the path like a car on a road, and then the limb movement and some cosmetic wiggling is added on top to make it look a bit more like animal locomotion. Same as the lizards. The arm walk is a bit different because it requires the path finder to use something else than the critters body as a reference. As far as the path finder is concerned, the critter &quot;is&quot; at the hand grabbing the pole, and from there it picks a path, finds a new grab position within reach along that path, and swings forward to reach it. <br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308164440im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/12/30/2870z.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>The trouble was of course transitioning between the two, but I think I&#039;ve got it down now! The decision procedure has a bit of a bias away from the arm walk, as the standard animation is intended to work in all situations whereas the arm walk is really bad at anything vertical, and horribly bad at anything that has to do with maneuvering into a small opening or similar precision work. For long stretches of horizontal pole the arm walk will generally kick in though.

The space does not look so good when the bars are gone. They could always stay in closed position, saving time and maintaining a narrow look. <br></div><br>Yes! Actually that is sort of why it&#039;s there. My reasoning is like this - with this little wait, you already have a bit of a stake in the game session as you go out into it - you have already invested 15 seconds. RW gameplay benefits hugely from higher stakes in my experience, if you care about surviving the nervous atmosphere is enhanced. Also this little wait creates a space for sort of debriefing and calming down before going out there again. &quot;What went wrong, what am I going to do differently now, what route should I take&quot; etc. Basically it&#039;s there to make the game <i>not </i>play like Super Meat Boy or similar, where you just throw yourself at death over and over. Not any disrespect to Meat Boy, I love McMillen and think he&#039;s an awesome game designer, but Meat Boy and Rain World are pursuing different goals. So the wait acts as ~ not a <i>penalty </i>for dying per se ~ but as an &quot;Okay, you messed up. Here you have another go. But calm down first, think over what went wrong, and start fresh.&quot; When playing the game, at least I am enjoing it, and I didn&#039;t really hear complaints about it on the PAX floor either which has to be a good thing for something so boring as waiting. But we&#039;ll see what happens when we get beta testers on it - maybe I&#039;ll have to speed it up quite a bit at the end of the day.<br><br>What is it about the background in the shelter machinery you don&#039;t like? Should I throw some more stuff in there?<br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308155515/https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.msg1138802#msg1138802">Quote from: Teod on May 13, 2015, 10:15:31 AM</a></div><div class="quote"><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308155515/https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.msg1138705#msg1138705">Quote from: jamesprimate on May 13, 2015, 01:51:45 AM</a></div><div class="quote">testing out a Shadow Urban room illuminated by lantern mice.

But then there are also sleeping lantern mice. So it&#039;s a sort of sour-sweet mix of both!<br><br><b>Update 427 </b><br>Yay, got pathing creatures to work while following through a region gate! Was actually not quite as horrible as I expected. Other than that, I fixed the weird bug alpha backers will know of where a lizard carrying you through a short cut sends you flying all over the screen. And made a few more art assets for Shadow Urban. James and I had a talk about the area aesthetics, and agreed that neither of us are big fans of how the effect colors on plants look in darkness, so I made a plant which doesn&#039;t use effect colors but is instead intended to look good just with the light sources moving over it. It looks decent in my test setup, but I&#039;ll have to see how it behaved in James&#039; actual implementations and maybe do some adjustments later on - it&#039;s a heavily procedural beast that isn&#039;t always predictable.

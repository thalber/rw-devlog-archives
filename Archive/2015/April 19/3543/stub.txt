Will there be rooms that transition between regions? For example, moving from Heavy Industrial to Garbage Wastes, leaving the dilapidated structures behind and gradually seeing more garbage and then reaching the rolling hills of the Wastes<br></div><br>I find myself wondering about how you are planning palette transitions as well? Seems like it could be a bit jarring to move from one radically different palette to another over the space of a single room.<br></div><br>ah yeah, this may be a bit of a design challenge. we have ideas for it, but will have to see how it goes in context. unfortunately, it seems like the completely open world is going to be unfeasible, especially since we are preparing for multiple platforms and generally would like average humans without supercomputers to be playing it. our proposed solution is to have a kind of transitional series of &quot;gate&quot; rooms between each region, huge dramatic doors and locking mechanisms, which might also house a shelter/save point. this allows for switching over the loaded region, as well as offer a neutral / dark palette to make the palette change less abrupt. we shall see!<br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308154809/https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?PHPSESSID=euc2ncsqa4j9ej13327mild4h2&amp;topic=25183.msg1130983#msg1130983">Quote from: oldblood on April 19, 2015, 06:04:43 AM</a></div><div class="quote"><tt>Not to be <i>THAT</i> guy but...<br><br>...When do we get another alpha build? <br></tt></div><br>Probably not for a little while, as we have some big deadlines coming up that we have to focus on.

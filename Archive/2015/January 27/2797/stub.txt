And in that case, it kind of makes sense for the player that a downwards moving shadow signifies a downwards moving creature. And yeah, it would look weird if it didn&#039;t have a shadow behind it &gt;___&lt; The current situation could be explained by the creature going up and back in the z dimension a bit, I guess.<br><br>Don&#039;t really do semi-transparency, it&#039;s an art style thing.

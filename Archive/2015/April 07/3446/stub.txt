I&#039;m spending two days in Boston with James, and we&#039;ve been doing some important work on mapping out the world, discussing how you will progress through the game etc. But, not a lot of the standard solitary work we usually do, i.e. levels and programming. Will get back to that as soon as I arrive in Sweden! So more updates to come soon, but we apologize for the lack of updates the last couple of days&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308154128im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/hand-thumbsup-r.gif" alt="Hand Thumbs Up Right" border="0">

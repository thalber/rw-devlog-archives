Thank you thank you thank you everybody :D Such an honor!<br><br>It&#039;s going to be really funny if this bring new traffic to the thread right now in the midst of Path Finding Week &nbsp;<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309172801im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/cheesy.gif" alt="Cheesy" border="0"> &quot;THIS won!?&quot;<br>Promise though, it&#039;ll be more exciting stuff again shortly.<br><br>And such an honor to win two times in a row! Let&#039;s just hope that next year we&#039;re not a part of the competition haha!<br><br>Yeah, the site needs updating badly... Right now the kickstarter updates seem like a more presentable link to send people, and that&#039;s upside down for sure. But as James say, neither of us really feel like taking time out of development to work on presentation... When we get closer to release that might make more sense, so it&#039;ll get an update <i>some time </i>~<br><br>Thanks again everybody! It really means a lot to know that all of you are reading and appreciating the devlog.

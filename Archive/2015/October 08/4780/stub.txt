Now obviously im talking about a stylized solution and not text with words and Xs, but something like this would be the baseline you want to see:<br><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;fed<br>starvation [ X X X X | X X - - | - - -] full<br><br><br><br>idk, i think previously we had been trying to avoid both status effects and UI, but its time to contemplate it! its interesting, at this point we have the things that we wanted to do with the game pretty well nailed down: the ecosystem, the look, the mood and the huge world exploration, but now its a matter of adjusting the gamification variables and presenting it in a way to encourage the player to continue through. i guess this what happens when you start with an art project and then work &quot;a game&quot; into it!<br><br><br>Along those lines, Joar and I were just discussing how we might maintain the players interest in keeping little sluggie surviving in such a death-filled environment. Especially since its (to a degree) a timed play-cycle, how do we make it so that the player doesnt want to just kill themselves to restart if their exploration or hunt isnt immediately going well? <br><br>This food meter system might offer a solution to that as well, if we think of the regions in a more traditional &quot;level&quot; fashion. With the region gates we have built in &quot;level start&quot; points and the shelters can act as checkpoints. A death when &quot;fed&quot; restarts the player at the the shelter, but a death when &quot;starving&quot; returns the player to the region gate that they entered, scrubbing any progression and giving strong incentive to keep sluggie alive and fed throughout.<br><br><br>Then hopefully something like this would allow enough &quot;open world&quot; to keep the gameplay from becoming too forced and linear, but also offers incentive for players that want to progress through the narrative and exploration. Also of course simply adding some sort of &quot;CYCLE 7 SURVIVED&quot; high-score count / achievements at the end of cycles could help further gamify this as well.<br><br><br>thoughts?

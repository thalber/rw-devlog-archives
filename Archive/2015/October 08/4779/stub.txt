Welcome! Yeah, agreed on all points! The &quot;carry over&quot; of bats has been a thing that has been up since &quot;maze runner&quot; days, and it&#039;s not at all out of the question. Would just have to come up with some UI solution for it that seems clean enough, and some kind of cap so you don&#039;t manage to get 55 bats through some exploit in one run and then don&#039;t ever have to hunt again.<br><br>Suicidal exploration should be kept at a minimum. One VERY rough measure that could be taken against this could be some kind of extra penalty if you die two times in a row - such as throwing you two save points back (naturally with a corresponding lowering of general game difficulty). That&#039;s... rough, though. The idea is that you should have enough time to both search and catch bats within the same cycle - if that&#039;s viable there won&#039;t really be any reason to do the suicide missions. <br><br>In later versions it has been made a bit simpler to catch the bats when you are in the swarm room. The idea behind this is that the bulk of the time should be spent exploring looking for the swarm room, not jumping around in frustration trying to catch some elusive bats once you&#039;ve actually gotten there. Together with a lower bat quota I think we have been taking some steps in the right direction since alpha days.<br><br>Visual indicators (UI or in-world) leading you towards the bats might become necessary, but if it&#039;s possible we&#039;d like to do without it. Would be a shame to impose on the atmosphere of the rooms with some ever-present visual element like that.<br><br>All of these ideas are totally possible, and it&#039;s a lot of fun to finally have arrived at the point where we&#039;re implementing and balancing stuff like this!

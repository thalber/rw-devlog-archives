For now the polish pass will be focused on improving whats already there and adding narrative / set-piece stuff rather than expansion per se, but there certainly will be some as a result. <br><br>As tedious as it may be on my end, whats nice about the modular room layout system we&#039;re using is that once a region map is setup its very easy for me to attach new rooms/paths, and therefore new content. ive setup pretty much every region with the potential for future expansion in mind, and the infrastructure can pretty much support as much additional content as we care to add. i have *LOTS* of ideas for this stuff, so hopefully the game will be successful enough so warrant it post-release.

@Schrompf, my shader-fu is not up there&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150627030417im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/cry.gif" alt="Cry" border="0"> What I do understand of what you say is that you&#039;re downsampling to lower resolutions and saving each resolution level as an overlay? But do you do this using a grab-pass on the entire screen? I don&#039;t write to a render texture to determine where there&#039;ll be light or not, each light source is just a sprite with a shader. This seems to be really fast as I don&#039;t need another render texture or even another grab pass, but it might come at a cost when doing stuff like that.<br><br>@Gimym JIMBERT hm yeah, that&#039;d be easy - just a full screen sprite which grabs everything rendered below it, does a simple blur, and then adds it back with a blend mode that makes everything lighter. Basically a bloom. I think I&#039;m going to do that either way, we have some plans where that might be just the trick, but in this specific case I want only the sunlight to have the bloom effect, so I&#039;ll have to figure something out for that specifically. Even though... hm... I could just do what I described above, except I ask the level texture about whether or not a pixel is lit, and if it&#039;s not I treat it as a black pixel... That should work! I&#039;ll give it a go!

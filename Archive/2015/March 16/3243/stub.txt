The way it&#039;s gonna work is that you&#039;ll be able to see the contour of your own character even without a light source, and you&#039;ll see the walls and whatever is in the foreground layer as well because these things will overlap the contour of the player character. I think we&#039;re going to have some rooms in the early dark areas that are hard to get <i>through </i>without a light source, but easy to get back <i>out of</i>, to make it so that you don&#039;t get stuck in the darkness unless you&#039;re particularly stubborn about going in there. If you are, however, it&#039;s no worse than hitting restart, the cycles will be fairly short so you won&#039;t lose all that many minutes of progress. <br><br>When it comes to bioluminescence, I&#039;m once again not all that worried about the science of whatever is going on. I think of this as a cartoon universe, and mood is generally much more important than science - whenever &quot;correct&quot; physics and biology helps to serve the mood they&#039;re very welcome (as in the case with the water surface, the algorithm is lifted from a simulation paper because it &quot;feels watery&quot;) but science takes the backseat whenever it&#039;s not compatible with the artistic vision. <br><br><b>Update 406</b><br><br>More messing around with the light shader.

I&#039;ll see what workaround I can come up with.

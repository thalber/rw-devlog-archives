Hiding in tunnels helps avoid them until they calm down, but should they find me out - I&#039;m dead, they&#039;re faster in tunnels than I am. That&#039;s why I mentioned the &quot;tight spaces&quot; - I meant tighter than standard tunnel, one that lizard can&#039;t fit into - would help survive, and since it&#039;s in map design, you still get to be mean here and there x) <br></div><br>totally a possibility! we will definitely be balancing the tunneling speed of the cat and other creatures for sure, plus possibly adding some sort of tunneling &quot;move set&quot; for the cat (heck, we haven&#039;t even discussed regular slugcat moves here yet!), so you can maybe get short bursts of movement in tunnels. another possibility is objects (or creatures) that can be used to block tunnels. but again, this is all a bit ahead of us!<br><br><br><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">Will there be more of such &quot;alpha&quot; releases on the way, just to see how the game is progressing? <br></div><br>I think we&#039;d like to do at least one more before actual beta? That is somewhat related to time, as whenever we do a public build it takes planning and a week or so of tying together random things to make it palatable for a non dev, and that time could be otherwise used for actually progressing work on The Game proper. PLUS you get a million emails about things that aren&#039;t in the build yet, etc etc. Pretty sure the next one will be focused on the multiplayer aspect though, which I think will be pretty fun to see.

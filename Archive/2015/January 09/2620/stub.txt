@AxezDNyde<br>Hey thanks! Yeah, I&#039;m really happy about the near-surface distortion as well <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309172312im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0"> It&#039;s actually just the horizontal distortion that&#039;s present everywhere in the water that gets increased with an exponent near the surface. For the caustics (thanks for teaching me that word) - actually they are not the same color as the static highlights, it&#039;s just the gif format that bakes them together. So the wall distortion thing you saw is probably not as bad in the actual game. As for the shader cycle speed, I want it to somewhat work with a pretty still surface as well as with an upset surface that you&#039;re currently swimming through, so I settled for a medium-ish speed. I <i>could </i>have it change speed depending on how tall the waves are, but I do tend to get caught up in little cosmetics like this forever, so I try to move on from that stuff at a reasonable time and get back to actual gameplay programming. Especially as if I know myself, walking down that road would mean having the speed be locally affected by the water below that specific place, and that seems like trouble :S<br><br>@akryl9296<br>Awesome map! <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309172312im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0"> Bigger it&#039;s gonna be - this is one area of like, ten o___0 Remember also that this was the first area James did, so it&#039;s a bit experimental. Being the first area, and maybe the most loosely defined theme-wise, I&#039;d bet that this particular one is going to go through some pretty damn big changes before release! Sorry to say when you&#039;ve spent so much time on that map... Feedback is most welcome! Just remember that everything is super WIP. You can either post it here or PM me, depending on if you think it would be an interesting read to others as well <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309172312im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0"><br><br>

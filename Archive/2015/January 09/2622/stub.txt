I like how big and complicated this region is - got myself lost more than few times, but always somehow ended up in region I knew and could get back to lair sooner or later. The way I see it now, it&#039;s good enough as it is despite few spots that need fixing.

Just something to jump around in for a bit!&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309172312im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/hand-joystick.gif" alt="Hand Joystick" border="0"> <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309172312im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0"> <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309172312im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/hand-anykey.gif" alt="Hand Any Key" border="0">

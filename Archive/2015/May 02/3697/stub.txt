DATE/YEAR PRESUMED, MIGHT BE WRONG

Good talk! I kind of agree on that jumping sound in particular, which might have something to do with me knowing the unprofessional circumstances it was created under haha! Think it was something like me blowing on my laptop mic and then messing around with a dynamic pitch bend in Cool Edit Pro <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505022238im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/facepalm.gif" alt="Facepalm" border="0"> Anyways, on the more general cartoony/naturalistic discussion, I think this is a really interesting topic. I won&#039;t lie, I think it could totally work out to just lean all the way over on the naturalistic side - realism can&#039;t really be <i>wrong</i>. It can be a bit boring however. The art and animation is always straddling this balance of nature documentary and cartoon - and though I know many are more interested in the nature doc side of it, I do believe that it would be worse off without the cartoon element. <br><br>It&#039;s like onions in cooking, no-one likes to just munch down on an onion, but it&#039;s not as simple as onions=bad and removing them makes the dish better. The onion does unexpected stuff when cooked, mixes stuff around, brings out the other tastes. Similarly it tastes better if you add salt, but if you add a lot of salt you hit diminishing returns. In the same way I think the cartoony elements in Rain World add some value. The natural first reaction is &quot;ewww cartoony&quot;, but if it was removed it would be obvious that something was missing.<br><br>It would be cool if the audio could strike the same balance the animation is already attempting. It&#039;s a fine balance though, and might take some tuning. That jump sound might be like biting into a rather large piece of un-cooked onion, to return to the analogy. Stuff should obviously not be jarring, it should feel like a smooth blend, but a smooth blend with some unexpected undertones is more interesting than just straight up one thing or the other.<br><br><b>Update 422</b><br>I&#039;m preparing for the big region connect/divide structural change where the game will actually become open world, one way or another. I want to know what I&#039;m doing with this one, as it&#039;s a rather important piece of the under-the-hood infrastructure. In the mean time while getting ready, I&#039;ve been doing some assorted messing around. Today I did a lot of small things - touching up the light shader, streamlining the player controls for some situations, fixing a few issues with the player animation, hunting down a few bugs, etc. Maintenance work. I have also been working on assets for the dark region, but you&#039;ll have to wait for James to start posting screen shots of that stuff. I think this one is going to be pretty interesting visually! Maybe I will do a little bit more misc stuff, but I feel like a game plan for the &quot;let&#039;s make this an actual open world game&quot; process is taking shape, so I&#039;ll get in there hopefully tomorrow or the day after.

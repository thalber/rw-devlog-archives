ah this is fun, thank you! no one ever gets into debates about audio design philosophy around here&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505022238im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/tearsofjoy.gif" alt="Tears of Joy" border="0"><br><br>in defense of le Mario Bros jumps, one of the reasons they remain to be used in many games is readability. in a sound environment like this where most of the mid-ground aural texture will be composed of various ambiguous white/pink noise elements (bat flaps, wind, gravel, crunching steps, water, etc etc), having a distinct palette for important moves is key, as it functions as significant &quot;aural UI&quot;. To the player in a chaotic sound environment, a white noise &quot;whoosh&quot; is useless in a sea of white noise &quot;wooshes&quot;.<br><br>also there is a point to be made about diagetic audio vs experiential audio. in my design philosophy, conveying the mood and a satisfying &quot;experience&quot; of the action / sound / music / etc. takes a slight precedence over some sort of cohesion ideal: just like with the visual UI debate, it is a game and sometimes there will need to be game sounds. the reason i kept this specific sproing from the lingo alpha is that it *feels really good* in-game, and i can say this comfortably without bias since its not &quot;my sound&quot;. I just like it!<br><br><b>*BUT*</b> these are much more general comments about these topics! I think in this case its very possible were just so used to hearing that &quot;pounce&quot; sound (after playing it for 3 years) that it can&#039;t possibly seem out of place to us. Our ears are TIN for this specific case! So if its sticking out then its sticking out, and i value your opinions, especially as you both went to great lengths to describe the context for them. You guys are the best!<br><br>In this version, that sound is a blend of the original alpha sproing sound tempered with a filtered white noise air woosh like Teod describes, so ill def try some re-leveling and blending of sporings keeping these opinions in mind. Im sure there is a balance where we can subtly satisfy our sproing lust and ALSO make it not sound like mickey mouse just dropped randomly into the screen for everybody else. And if not, other options will be explored! <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505022238im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/hand-thumbsup-r.gif" alt="Hand Thumbs Up Right" border="0">&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505022238im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/hand-thumbsup-r.gif" alt="Hand Thumbs Up Right" border="0">&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505022238im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/hand-thumbsup-r.gif" alt="Hand Thumbs Up Right" border="0"><br><br>edit:<br><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: tortiseandcrow</div><div class="quote">I get the impression from the levels that Rain World is such a soggy place that you could probably get away with using modified water sounds for pretty much everything.</div><br>oh! i wanted to talk about this a little, as Joar had said something similar. with such a large world that we have going on, in my opinion uniformly coating everything with a similar aural texture would be a huge missed opportunity for immersion, especially since its so easy to implement a more dynamic solution! its those subtle differences that add so much IMHO<br><br>and ill be honest, there is no way my obsessive audio micromanagement tendencies would let such a thing fly XD

@Christian, yep, all of those are possible! When it comes to creatures with eyes on the sides, that&#039;s hard in this weird 2D context, as the sides would be towards and away from the camera. What makes sense from a gameplay and sneak perspective is having the vision be concentrated in front of the creature.<br><br>@tortoiseandcrow haha I will do the test run soooon! I&#039;m just way too bad at actually playing the game hehe<br><br><b>Update 445</b><br><br>Made lizards swim. These standard sub-species generally just swim at the surface of the water, and quite awkwardly. But at least they can swim now! It felt really weird to have that strange cop-out with lizards dying in water but nothing else - the game world has been taken beyond that sort of stuff since then. With that out of the way there is another interaction that makes sense, and one less strange exception the player needs to learn.<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308161103im_/https://giant.gfycat.com/VainMildAmurstarfish.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Also it looks funny!

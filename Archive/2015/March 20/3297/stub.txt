i see huge potential for a CheetosÂ® brand rain world DLC tie in! lemme get on the phone...<br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309161854/https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?PHPSESSID=k32beo4pifiikmgsk0k32lbps1&amp;topic=25183.msg1121772#msg1121772">Quote from: Teod on March 20, 2015, 04:53:31 AM</a></div><div class="quote">This discussion is conveniently timed with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309161854/https://youtube.com/watch?v=q5z7Uh4dWZk" target="_blank">REroll&#039;s review of Shelter 2</a>, which discusses the game&#039;s shortcomings with this exact animalistic feeling we want from the Rain World.<br></div><br>OHHHHHH this is a great link, thanks. i havent played any games with this sort of mechanic before, so really cool to hear such a passionate defense of that flavor. the reviewers perspective lines up exactly with my own.<br><br>as for UI and text, we&#039;re definitely going to have as little of that as possible and NONE if we can. definitely none that is in the game world. threats of predators and food scarcity should be motivation enough to push the player into the world without needing any real need for hand-holding or &quot;go here!&quot; signs, and once they are in it we can do all manner of things. <br><br>Right now there is only one instance of text where we dont have a solid solution for, and thats indicating to the player how many bats / foods you need for the next hibernation cycle and how many you have eaten. right now its just a little number that pops up, and while that does the job (and could be considered an acceptable design compromise as the easiest possible solution), i&#039;d prefer a more stylish means if we can. but again, thats polish stuff down the line.<br><br>as for tutorial, im confident that we can just design early room challenges / set pieces that teach the basic controls and experience (this is a pole, you must learn to climb it to get out of this room. this is a shortcut, its the only way to the top so figure it out, etc etc) and let the player work through it. Pretty much every region adds new mechanics to learn, so the beginning rooms of each have a set of movement puzzles to introduce you to what will be needed to progress. Whats nice about having a big interconnected map is that we&#039;ll have multiple paths through the world, so if a player cant deal with the mechanics of one region, they can just find another way!<br><br>showing the most recent build at PAX was cool because for the first time we could actually just hand the controller to someone without a word and see how they made do. and even in this unfinished state it seemed like pretty much anyone who was willing to sit with it for more than a minute could figure it out just fine, which was a bit of a relief let me tell you!

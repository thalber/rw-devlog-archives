It&#039;s always been my intention that the story of rain world is that of the character, rather than that of the world, and that it is produced by the game engine rather than through writing. If you decide to take down a Vulture, and actually succeed, <i>that </i>is the story. If you save pups, or don&#039;t, or befriend some creature or kill some creature, that is the story. <br><br>That said, we do love our environments and of course we have ideas about what&#039;s what in the world, and we would like to try some &quot;environmental storytelling.&quot; But don&#039;t expect to get some super clear linear array of events spelled out to you haha, we&#039;ll be hinting here and there but you&#039;ll have to do most of the work yourself. <br><br>The main character is a creature that&#039;s somewhere on the edge between animal and human thinking, meaning that it can only almost make sense of what it sees around it. It can maybe understand that the symbols on the wall bear meaning, but it can&#039;t understand the meaning. It can see that one machine connects to another through pipes, but it can&#039;t decipher the functionality much beyond that. It can guess that this big place might have served some big purpose, but it can never quite reach a clear understanding of that purpose. We want to mirror this experience in the player.<br><br>Man, NYC subway rats are such an awesome source of inspiration! It&#039;s exactly the thing - they live in a huge weird environment which they have no idea about why it looks like it does, and they mind their own business. I saw one yesterday that had its home in a drain pipe between the tracks, coming out between trains to look for cheetos and whatnot people might have thrown down there. Does the rat understand what a drain pipe is? Maybe some incredibly vague notion is in there, but a full understanding of what&#039;s going on will always be beyond reach. Still the pipe <i>works </i>as a place to live, and the intentions of the almighty creatures that once created the drain pipe isn&#039;t all that relevant to the rat at the end of the day - cheetos are. <br><br>So, if the back story is the complete architectural blueprint of a subway station, expect to understand about as much of it as a rat living between the tracks of said station <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309161854im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/cheesy.gif" alt="Cheesy" border="0"> I&#039;m joking, but yeah ~ we won&#039;t spoon feed you any back story for sure. You&#039;ll have to work really hard to piece stuff together, and even then you won&#039;t have a complete picture. Mystery is a huge part of the appeal, and if the entire back story was available on the internet a week after release that would sort of ruin the experience. Instead you&#039;ll get some scattered pieces to make your mind wander by itself&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309161854im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0"><br><br>Oh, another thing - Rain World isn&#039;t a <i>planet </i>lol&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309161854im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/cheesy.gif" alt="Cheesy" border="0"> Or I guess it might probably be on a planet, just as Lord of The Rings, Sex And The City, Zelda and Frankenstein&#039;s Monster are probably technically on a planet, but just as in those examples the <i>planet </i>aspect isn&#039;t really relevant at all. Rain World is more of a fantasy world or a dream world, not somewhere you can go in a space ship ~

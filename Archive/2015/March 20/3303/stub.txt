after a few crash and burn attempts at doing shadow urban &quot;in the darkness&quot; level design last night, it occurred to me that *maybe* doing levels without 1.) the illumination system in place 2.) any of the dark-specific creature ecology or 3.) any of the region tiles done... is probably a terrible idea. i was so excited though!!<br><br>switching gears a bit, going to focus on something we know exactly what were doing with, the second aerial region: sky islands. <br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308153346im_/https://i.imgur.com/2fiTR1wl.png" alt="" border="0"><br>detail:<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308153346/https://i.imgur.com/2fiTR1w.png" target="_blank">https://i.imgur.com/2fiTR1w.png</a><br><br>Joar whipped up some cool ornate looking ornamented tiles and has some radio antennae looking stuff in the works that will give this region a very unique look (think of a refined, brass-hued oasis set on scaffolding high above the clouds), and with that i should be able to get through a good chunk of this region while he&#039;s busy working on... dun dun dun... the dreaded and much put-off level editor overhaul.&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308153346im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/monoclepop.gif" alt="My Word!" border="0">

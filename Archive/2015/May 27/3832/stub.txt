oh there is still plentyyyyy of time left for dev. so dont think ill let him get off so easy on the creature bestiary XD <br><br>also, its not like each creature has to be MIT CS research paper level. hes been enthusiastically tackling the hardest ones first, but sprinkling some easy to implement / dum AI creatures that flop around will add a TON to the atmosphere but shouldnt kill us with time.

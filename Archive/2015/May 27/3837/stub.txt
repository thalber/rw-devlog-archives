Oh those are awesome Chris <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309173141im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0"> Love the little slugcat face! Suburban, Drainage System, Heavy Industrial and Sky Islands (or Chimney Canopy, but that palette is the Sky Islands palette now, there has been a little switching around). I know them all too well by now!<br><br>Today I don&#039;t really have a good update for you guys, the work day has not been going amazingly <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309173141im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0"> I started out by finishing the vulture sound trigger placement, and then moved on to water sound trigger placement where I got stuck because my sound engine has become a convoluted mess. So I cried to James about that for a while before giving up, had lunch and walked the dog. If I didn&#039;t tell you guys, I&#039;ve moved from NY to the swedish country side, and NY problems have been replaced with swedish country side problems - long story short the dog chased a cat up a tree, in the middle of the woods. It was a really tall tree and it seemed the cat couldn&#039;t get down, why I spent most of the afternoon in angst over the cat in the tree, and attempted a very failed rescue mission involving me climbing up with a sports bag that the cat did <i>not</i> want to get in. Don&#039;t worry though, last time I returned to the scene there was no cat in the tree and also no dead cat in the perimeter below the tree, so the cat seems to have been able to climb down after all. I basically had the same amount of trouble as I usually have with my digital little animals, just with meat space animals instead...<br><br>Sooo, I finally got back to the grind, where I&#039;ve gotten started on an interface for changing what rooms will be flooded and what rooms will be rained on, and it&#039;s going quite well so far. This interface will also allow for some other room settings such as palette fades etc, that are well due by now. <br><br>In the mean time, James has been finishing up Shadow Urban, and I&#039;ve given it my first spin! Don&#039;t want to say too much as we decided that this would be our semi-secret region, but I can say that it&#039;s quite beautiful and really creepy at times :D

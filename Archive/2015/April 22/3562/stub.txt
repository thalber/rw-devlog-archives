personally, from where it is now id prefer not to have an in-game map, as from my perspective learning the terrain is a good part of the experience. the game as we conceive of it isnt really about &quot;getting places&quot; so much as it is wallowing around in the world.<br><br>the way the world map is laid out, there isnt really emphasis on dead ends: every path generally leads somewhere, though the challenges and experiences in each route differ. you&#039;re always getting *somewhere*. this goes the same for region to region connections as it does room to room connections. since there isnt really &quot;keys&quot; outside of things you might generally find in a region, or much in the way of item objectives per se, multiple routes to every destination, and the creature migrations that give you a sense of general direction (as gimmy mentioned), i dont think a map is especially *necessary* unless as a player concession. but we&#039;ll see how it goes! so far there hasnt been any mention from anyone while playtesting it, though we have yet to connect the whole world and that might shake things up quite a bit.<br><br>oh another thing to mention is that the rooms arent laid out in a 2d x/y fashion. in fact, *soft spoiler alert*: we are planning some regions where the connections and orientations are VERY not 2D, if you catch my drift. So a room-specific map probably wouldnt even be possible. but if necessary, i could see some sort of vague region map working to preserve the mystery and also not driving players mad. <br><br>anyway, like so many things, thats a ways away. Joar just hit me up with a COLOSSAL editor update, so i am digging through that and happily playing with piles of refuse and junk in the garbage wastes!<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308154827im_/https://i.imgur.com/63SIfMWl.png" alt="" border="0"><br>detail: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308154827/https://i.imgur.com/63SIfMW.png" target="_blank">https://i.imgur.com/63SIfMW.png</a><br><br>how does s/he stay so clean in all that gunk??

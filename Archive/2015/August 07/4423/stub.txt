Possibly something to do with the managed/unmanaged code mix in Unity?<br><br>Try opening up the &#039;Threads&#039; window while paused and see if there&#039;s any other threads running that you can peek into, they might help you track down your issue.<br><br></div><br>Yeah, this is the idea I&#039;ve gotten after some research too - and last time I had similar problems it also showed to be about this. Problem is that I basically don&#039;t know what &quot;symbols&quot; are, this is where some kind of education could have come in handy I guess haha :S Is there some simple explanation? What I understood last time was that it was some kind of registry keeping track of where each point in the compiled code was coming from in the uncompiled code, so that if something went wrong it could show where and why and launch the debugger ... is that about right? <br><br>When the symbols are missing for a piece of code, how can you like, tell it to add that code in then? Or why doesn&#039;t it do that automatically?<br><br>For your more practical idea - in VS all the windows are empty, I only get that message and that&#039;s it. In mono develop I can pause and it shows a call stack and a thread, named something that makes me think it has to do with waiting (as in some kind of framerate cap) but no code, and there&#039;s nothing I can recognize as written by me.&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309211317im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/huh.gif" alt="Huh?" border="0"><br><br>Well, at least I solved the problem by now, good old manual way ~&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309211317im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/hand-thumbsup-r.gif" alt="Hand Thumbs Up Right" border="0">

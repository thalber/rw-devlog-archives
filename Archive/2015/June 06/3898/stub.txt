Placing sound triggers, placing sound triggers, placing sound triggers...<br><br>@hypedupdawg, nah, not really possible, the level images are created by the level editor and then rendered to a static texture. One of the big technical hold backs we&#039;re constantly fighting with!<br><br>@Jimym GIMBERT, whatever built this place had two distinct alphabets, as you can see in the neon signs. The graffiti generally uses stylized versions of the same alphabets. I&#039;m going to include some typographic graffiti because I like the look of it, but there&#039;ll also be some graffiti that is more &quot;out there&quot;, such as the big spleen or whatever in that picture James posted. I want to explore that direction more, to create that sense of &quot;why the hell would someone draw this!?&quot; in order to further make you empathize with the slugcat&#039;s semi-animal nature; it can understand that the signs and images convey some sort of meaning, but can only have a very dim and confused grasp of what that meaning would be.

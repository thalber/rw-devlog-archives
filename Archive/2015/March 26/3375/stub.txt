Oh, this room is actually just a room I threw together for James to demo the tiles. It has aaaall the ornament tiles in it, and no slime or rust effects, so it totally doesn&#039;t look Rain World enough for Rain World. The actual rooms James has been making are&nbsp; more worn down and less fairy tale-ey. They do have a bit of that quality though, and at least I think that&#039;s an interesting visual contrast - as the huge antennae rise towards the sky they take on a lighter and more ethereal quality.<br><br>@Christian, yeah it&#039;s some sort of antennae and relay technology. Some sort of signal is being broadcast or received. In this area there&#039;ll be less heavy machines and pipes, and instead more fine machinery (assumedly more information technology rather than heavy industrial technology)

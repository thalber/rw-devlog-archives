Thanks! Yeah that&#039;s my thinking as well, the visual style is such an important component we don&#039;t necessarily want to compromise it.<br><br><b>Update 408</b><br>Took a small pause from overhaul to implement a bloom filter for the Sky Islands palette:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309162242im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/03/26/9XSYV.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>The shader is active, so when stuff moves in front of it the bloom is affected by the sprites:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309162242im_/https://giant.gfycat.com/EveryEagerChinesecrocodilelizard.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>It&#039;s most prominent towards the top/left corner of the screen (where the light source is). Still needs some tuning, I think it might be a bit too much right now.<br><br>The shader only adds, never subtracts, meaning that any given color can only be made lighter, not darker. This is why the black vulture gets affected by the bloom, but not the white slugcat.<br><br>I don&#039;t know if you can notice, but this time around I made the blur check for neighbors diagonally rather than in the straight lateral directions, which looks a bit nicer IMO. The truly ideal case would probably be a circular gaussian blur, but that&#039;d be several times as expensive, so I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s worth it. I suspect my computer has a pretty strong graphics card, so I have to be careful not to program the shaders too heavy to actually work on most machines.

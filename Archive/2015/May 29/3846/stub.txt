oh, we have a website: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308160140/http://rainworldgame.com/" target="_blank">http://rainworldgame.com</a><br><br>and like everything else it is absurdly out of date. but its like... we could spend a day updating that or we could do *actual work*, and with the crazy impossible deadlines we are slaving for, you can see what our choice tends to be.<br><br>but that said, there is a plan! (sort of.) If a couple of things come together we might be doing a re-brand for E3, fingers crossed. If that winds up being the case, updated website stuff is definitely in order. Also, a little bit further down the line once we start showing off the multiplayer build, i&#039;ll be gearing things up for streamers, and that will be our big pre-release push so efforts will be made.<br><br>for now though, keeping the head down and grinding it out. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308160140im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/brofist-r.png" alt="Bro Fist Right" border="0"> <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308160140im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/brofist-r.png" alt="Bro Fist Right" border="0">

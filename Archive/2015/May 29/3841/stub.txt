<b>Update 432</b><br>Woho! The last couple of days I&#039;ve been working on a new part of infrastructure for the game which will be very important for the visual aspects. Basically the game consists of a bunch of rooms, as know. The pipeline was that the macromedia director application spit those rooms out in an incredibly slow rendering process, and generally everything that had to do with that room specifically had to happen in the director editor and then go through that rendering. Now I have set up this new separate system which will mostly be supporting the visual stuff. Basically it&#039;s a second .txt file that contains data on what palette the room is using, if the room is considered by the game as an outdoors or indoors location, and other data that will come along such as the placement of cosmetic objects. There&#039;s a little editor interface for this stuff in the Unity application, where you can load and save the settings etc. Also there&#039;s an inheritance system in place, where you can create setting templates for the regions and have the rooms in that region inherit from the templates. So you can do stuff such as setting up a region template that contains the palette for a region, and then all rooms will have that palette unless you specifically tell a room to override it. <br><br>There isn&#039;t all that much settings at this point, but the idea is to start filling that stuff in now. Thing I have in mind is for example region-specific fauna of little cosmetic insects, palette fades as you move through the world, and so on. Placement of ambient sounds and different game objects will also branch off of this system in the future.<br><br>I&#039;ve passed all of this over to Prime Content Creator James Primate, so he can start working with his regions. Before sending it over I&#039;ve been trying it out a little myself though, and already I think there is some cool stuff that can be done. For example I&#039;ve made it so that the interior rooms in Sky Islands have a different, slightly shadier, palette than the exteriors. There&#039;s going to be a lot of little graphical touches like that coming up!<br><br>Anyhow, with the system up and running I can now move on to more specific cosmetic stuff. Hope to have something gifable soon!

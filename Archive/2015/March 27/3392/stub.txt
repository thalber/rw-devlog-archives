I trust James to be responsible with it though - if the props go mainly in the background layers or in out-of-reach areas this won&#039;t pose a problem. What it will do is allow us to explore new and more interesting visual possibilities. Think of it, it&#039;s actually infinitely impressive that he has been able to create the impression of decay and destruction without ever being able to place any object at an angle&nbsp; Who, Me? This tool will allow for fallen down structures resting against other structures, bent shapes, and also non-destruction based stuff such as just cogs and gears sitting along different angles. </div><br>YEAH. def. considering how established the visual style is at this point, adding this whole new universe of angles has to be done pretty subtly. Ill admit im a little apprehensive about it tbh. The region its &quot;intended&quot; for (in my mind) is the Garbage Wastes, in which having angular junk sticking out in the background is just a good look, and if that winds up having a more unique look to it as a result then so much the better. so anyway i&#039;ll have a bit of a prop editor sandbox to play in and develop technique with it before applying it elsewhere. if we can get some cool stuff out of it there, i&#039;ll go back and add them in to the regions already done in a 2nd/3rd pass.

The idea that you can under-eat once, but not twice in a row, seems to make sense! But how to communicate it? It seems a little harsh that first you survive eating too little, but the next time BAM total binary death haha!<br><br>So box blur is essentially just about scaling a texture? Do you do that in the shader language, or somewhere else?<br><br>Yep, know that the bloom is a bit too much in that gif&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150401072917im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/whome.gif" alt="Who, Me?" border="0"><br><br>Thanks jimbert!<br><br><b>Update 409</b><br><br>In other news, huge milestone reached! The overhauled editor is now on par with the old editor! Basically meaning that nothing (that wasn&#039;t already, hehe) is broken, and the editor can do everything the old one could and then some - it can for example spit out huuuuuge rooms, and James now has control over the screen skewing effect going on rather than it being random, and some minor UI stuff and misc little errors are fixed. <br><br>I still estimate that it will be a couple of days more before we&#039;re actually through to the other side of the overhaul, but from here on the overhaul will be about adding new stuff rather than adapting the rendering pipeline to accommodate for larger rooms.<br><br>What new stuff? I have two things I want to do, though their actual level editor implementation might be somewhat merged. The first one is the Prop Editor. <br><br>Currently everything you see in RW is a &quot;tile&quot;, which is basically a graphical asset that can be placed on top of terrain and will then be rendered. Tiles have specific terrain requirements, one might be 2*3 tiles large for example, and require each of these tiles to be solid except the top left corner, which should be a slope. This way James can first create a &quot;geometry&quot; (lots of RW editor lingo here, sorry - it&#039;s a very limited little set of technical terms used pretty much only by James and me), which is a map of the room where it&#039;s visible where there is solid terrain, where there is not, where there are slopes, etc. Then he &quot;tiles&quot; the geometry in another editor, by adding these graphical assets in places where their terrain requirements makes them fit. Basically this process guarantees that what looks like solid terrain will also be solid terrain.<br><br>The problem with this is that all the graphics are strictly on the grid, and can never be rotated. The Prop Editor will allow for adding &quot;props&quot;, which will basically work just like the current graphical assets except that they will be more free - you will be able to rotate them and place them anywhere, not only on the grid.<br><br>Yes, this has the potential of messing things up by allowing for placement of stuff that <i>looks </i>like solid terrain in areas where there isn&#039;t any solid terrain. I trust James to be responsible with it though - if the props go mainly in the background layers or in out-of-reach areas this won&#039;t pose a problem. What it will do is allow us to explore new and more interesting visual possibilities. Think of it, it&#039;s actually infinitely impressive that he has been able to create the impression of decay and destruction <i>without ever being able to place any object at an angle</i>&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150401072917im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/whome.gif" alt="Who, Me?" border="0"> This tool will allow for fallen down structures resting against other structures, bent shapes, and also non-destruction based stuff such as just cogs and gears sitting along different angles.<br><br>The other editor I want to add is the Decal Editor. This one will allow to place assets in the world in a similar manner, but instead of rendering as actual objects, they will render as custom color on top of the surfaces behind them. This one will probably be used pretty sparsely, because Rain World&#039;s art style relies on the backgrounds being sort of monochrome with the colored creatures standing out against it. But we have a couple of ideas for which some custom color is needed, and I think it will add some spice to the world with a little color here and there.<br><br>Not all of these colors will necessarily be &quot;colorful&quot;, either. The decal editor will also be able to do stuff such as a brown-grey line along the edge of a basin, indicating where the water level might once have been, and similar little touches.<br><br>So, now to doing it&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150401072917im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/cheesy.gif" alt="Cheesy" border="0"> Wish me luck!

Namely, that it sounds like you will be showing the illustration with the bat symbols once at the very start. The player will then need to remember how many bats they needs to eat, as well as how many they have already eaten, through the rest of the cycle with no feedback to indicate when they have had enough. Add in the number of bats each pup needs to eat, and try to keep track of how much each has already eaten and it become very easy to lose track and have someone starve.<br><br>Will you have loading screens or something similar where you can reinforce and update the information about how many bats each character still needs? I don&#039;t think that telling the player once at the start of each cycle is going to cut it.<br></div><br>I don&#039;t believe that&#039;s what he means. He wasn&#039;t addressing the U.I. problem with the bats; rather, he was addressing our comments about the slugcats looking hungry, or fat, etcetera. Previously, it seems like he wanted to do this, but didn&#039;t want to compromise the visuals during gameplay, and this seems like a good solution.<br><br>With this in mind, I would <i>guess</i> that he plans on implementing &quot;soft hunger&quot;, or rather, the ability to not quite catch the total of bats, but still scrape through with the requirement of catching more in the next hunt. I&#039;m sure testing will show whether this will be enough to do away with the bat u.i. entirely, but I have a feeling it&#039;s going to stick around in some form or another.<br></div><br>Yep yep!<br><br>&quot;Soft hunger&quot; - yeah maybe? Don&#039;t want it to be too floaty though. Maybe you could have it so that you can get away with exactly one fewer bats than required. The problem of having a penalty such as having to catch one more the next hunt is that the hibernation is also where the game saves, so then you could potentially have your game saved into an if not unwinnable at least dire situation. Contrary if you have no penalty, it&#039;s effectually just a matter of the UI showing one more bat than you actually need. Also a penalty would punish players who&#039;re performing badly, which is something I&#039;m hesitant about. Obviously not in the short time scale, like if you miss a jump you fall down, that sort of &quot;penalty&quot; should be in there definitely. But bogging down a player who&#039;s not performing well with some lasting punishment that bleeds over into the next cycle seems unfair to me.<br><br>Bloom - yeah, I know about the two-pass technique, but it&#039;s not applicable here. Because I don&#039;t blur the entire image, I just want to blur out from whatever pixels are the palette defined sky color. If I did first a vertical blur, then when it was time for the horizontal all the pixels would be muddied up and there&#039;d be no clean sky color pixels left.<br><br>What&#039;s box blur? Sounds interesting!<br><br>My friend recently sent me a link to an article about how you can do cheap gaussian, and I&#039;ll look into that to see if there&#039;s anything I can extract. The tricky part is that I&#039;m actually not just doing a straight up blur, I need to have only some specific pixels emit the blur...

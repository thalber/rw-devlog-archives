Heavy Industry features one, but only as a transition set piece into the Shadow Urban region, so adding that in later on a second pass is no problem. Sky Islands starts to introduce them as actual functional pieces in the region layout, but i would have still wanted time to develop the look and style of the region before digging into that. and thats how it happened! so basically....<br><br>~~~ &gt;&gt;&gt;----------&gt; ((o)) bullseye!<br><br>only problem is that now i have to actually DO them and am anticipating that these large multiscreens will each take some serious time. perhaps 2ish days each, and the rendering will be pretty painful. but nothing to do other than just get into it. ill start out tonight with a 2x2 and see how it goes!

In that regard, *i humbly request that these not be shared around* as we intend to do a cool &quot;Big Reveal&quot; sort of thing when it is all polished and where we want it to be.

These just are some of the early pose sketches shes done for us so far: <br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160726070611im_/http://i.imgur.com/sx89CJRl.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Detail: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160726070611/https://i.imgur.com/sx89CJR.jpg" target="_blank">https://i.imgur.com/sx89CJR.jpg</a><br><br><br></div><br><br>@ Oldblood: indeed indeed! its a really big change from the past...3? 4? years. tbh I expected much more of a *cars flipped and trashcans on fire* sort of response, so im quite relieved, haha. <br><br>The clean style of the fonts will follow through to the UI and blend really well with the updated aspects of the visual presentation, which is super essential. As much as we both liked the funky distorted style of the alpha and the clever architectural rain silhouettes, they just introduce too much visual noise to be able to do anything else with, meaning that we&#039;d have to be introducing other fonts, figure out ways of making it work with the illustrations, and it just gets super messy. <br><br>Perhaps most importantly, we came to the conclusion that the thing people care about in Rain World is THE SLUGCAT of course. So thats where we should to put the focus. Everything else should serve to support that, rather than fight for visual space.

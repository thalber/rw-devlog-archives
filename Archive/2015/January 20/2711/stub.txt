Gimmy! Welcome back! Missed ya!<br><br><b>Update 384</b><br><br>Making slow but steady progress on the kraken.<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20200514093017im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/01/20/l0yKJ.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Right now I&#039;m working on the transitions between flying and climbing states.<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20200514093017im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/01/20/Qg4E.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>It actually has the ability to fly with one tentacle and climb with the other right now, though I&#039;m not sure if I love it. If it&#039;s to do that, I&#039;d want it to be just to give itself a little boost now and then during a difficult bit while climbing, not the tentacle locking into fly mode for a long time. I&#039;ll see what I can do about it.<br><br>The idea is that it should be faster while flying, but have better control while climbing. Not quite the case yet... More work needed. Stay tuned!

@rainworldisawesome and tortiseandcrow: yesss thanks for the support! these 2 posts pretty much exactly sum up my feelings on the subject&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309162437im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/hand-metal-r.gif" alt="Hand Metal Right" border="0"><br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309162437/https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?PHPSESSID=t4i9kie2g9bk9otn2dtlng8j11&amp;topic=25183.msg1133153#msg1133153">Quote from: Christian on April 25, 2015, 05:05:49 PM</a></div><div class="quote">So I had mentioned the devlog in another forum earlier today and that got mw browsing the earlier pages again. It&#039;s incredible how far the game has come and how consistent the game has stayed over the past three years. Like you had Canopy rooms already all the way back in 2012<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309162437im_/https://i.imgur.com/QlCJbK6.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br></div><br>ill take this as a huge compliment! the reason for this is that pretty much all of the regions/rooms/etc were either directly inspired by or extrapolated from Joar&#039;s levels in the first alpha. He would do a room or two with a distinct look and gameplay mechanic (say the sky islands/chimney canopy look there, with the &quot;small platforms separated by pipes and fall death&quot; mechanic)&nbsp; then move on to something else 2 rooms later. I took the most compelling ones of those little micro-regions and fleshed them out, picking apart all the ways that specific combination of game elements could be exploited, then built the larger &quot;region&quot; narrative to support that and give it some context. <br><br>For instance that room you posted above from the alpha exists in the current Sky Islands region. I saw that room as the top-most part of a large antennae structure, so its modified a little to fit that concept:<br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309162437im_/https://i.imgur.com/vdjmvFPl.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>but then got to flesh out all the cool inbetween stuff to get to that point: <br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309162437im_/https://i.imgur.com/9Ph6bWYl.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>The larger scale world-building was essentially the same thing, taking these already strong looks / mechanics and hashing out what each implied about the greater world: &quot;if this sky islands region is up in the air, whats below it? whats to the right? what is holding it up? why is it there?&quot; etc., and then working to put it into some sort of cohesive whole. The ideal being a world map that explores all these various mechanics and does so in an exciting, comprehensible fashion.<br><br>So far so good! The only problem is knowing exactly when to quit the extrapolation engine and say &quot;yep this is enough!&quot; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309162437im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/tongue.gif" alt="Tongue" border="0">

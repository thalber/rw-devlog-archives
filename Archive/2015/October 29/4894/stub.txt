I want to see these guys get chopped in half by a spear. And even for other creatures, like the big daddy&#039;s tentacles or the lizards&#039; tails.

I haven&#039;t really ever been taking any conscious steps towards making the game violent or brutal, and was initially quite surprised when people were expressing that impression, considering how extremely gory games there are out there. Maybe it&#039;s because of the emergent animation giving the action a slightly different flavor than what we&#039;re used to seeing? Like, more desperate and fumbling rather than cool and cartoony. Anyway, I&#039;m cool with the game being brutal the way it is - it feels contextual and is a means to the end of supporting the artistic idea - but I don&#039;t want to go further. The spears produce a few ambiguous droplets when it hits something, but I think that will be the extent of it for blood!<br><br>Also it would be a technical nightmare to try to implement at this point&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308163622im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0"><br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308163622/https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?PHPSESSID=0c5dmm0u7vs59b451hcd948fn3&amp;topic=25183.msg1193394#msg1193394">Quote from: Christian on October 29, 2015, 02:02:17 AM</a></div><div class="quote">Here&#039;s the general pitch I post every time someone asks what the game is about over in the GAF thread:<br><br><i>Rain World is a survival stealth platformer set in a sprawling open world. You play as a slugcat, a lithe intelligent creature in the middle of a dynamic ecosystem brought to life through procedurally-generated animations and complex AI. An intelligent civilization existed before, but now only the decayed ruins and eroded infrastructure remain as remnants of that long-gone culture.<br>Oppressive darkness, dank rusting cisterns, rolling hills of detritus, metropolitan ruins, and much more are waiting to be explored. Rain World&#039;s industrial jungle is home to predators and prey of all kinds. Relentless hunters, camouflaged stalkers, creatures at home in the murky depths and open skies, things lurking in places where the sun never shines...</i><br></div><br>Damn, that&#039;s really really good, covers basically everything about the game! Would you mind if we drew from this in our own material when promotion times come around?<br><br><b>Update 494</b><br><br>Touching up stuff. We are finalizing the subterranean region, and with that comes the usual polish work - only this time half of it is secret!

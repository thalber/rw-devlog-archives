Thanks and welcome!<br><br>Yo eigen, cool to have you check by! Moonman&#039;s looking like it&#039;s coming along great!<br><br><b>Update 490</b><br><br>Basically everything I&#039;m up to these days is secret stuff, but at least here&#039;s something I can share:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309211400im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/10/24/gP48e.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>This is a second food source for slugcat - there will probably be one or two more edible things/creatures in the game as it looks now. Having bats as the only food source in the entire game became sort of a liability in terms of what we can do in the later regions especially, so we will throw in a few other things as well for variation. <br><br>

Also it wasn&#039;t quite dangerous enough for the huge fearsome fields he was making. The two birds with one stone solution was to make the worm grass transition to this super worm grass in larger patches, which also works a bit differently than the original worm grass - rather than tracking the pull of each worm it works tile by tile, creating a more classic gamey &quot;lava&quot; effect; basically if you fall down there you die. <br><br>We plan on making large swaying seas of this, with the rain deer striding across it. I think it&#039;s gonna look really cool!

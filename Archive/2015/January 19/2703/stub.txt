The gifs shows a long tentacle because the more tentacle I have, the clearer I can see what&#039;s going right/wrong. The actual kraken will have substantially shorter tentacles/wings.<br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200514093017/https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.msg1101588#msg1101588">Quote from: hopoo on January 19, 2015, 11:41:42 AM</a></div><div class="quote"><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200514093017/https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.msg1101495#msg1101495">Quote from: tortoiseandcrow on January 19, 2015, 07:35:51 AM</a></div><div class="quote"><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">The delayed tile space tentacle looks great, even with the curls it looks very alive.

The &quot;ghost&quot; tentacle, with its curls and swoops, almost seems more natural in its movements than the &quot;real&quot; tentacle following that pathing. I wonder if increasing the tension and decreasing the elasticity of the connections between the pathing ghost and the tentacle nodes would resolve the clumping issue. Right now it definitely looks like it is being pulled, rather than muscular movement.<br><br>Also AAAAAAAAAAH that thing is way longer than I anticipated! I really hope that there will be extensive, maze-like warrens of tunnels to hide in when that thing is around...<br></div>I also agree, the ghost tentacle looks better. The reason it looks like its being suddenly yanked around is because instead of the acceleration being parabolic, its negative exponential, if that makes sense.<br><br>Right now it is: |&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|&nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; | |||<br><br>It should be:&nbsp; &nbsp; || |&nbsp; |&nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|&nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; | | ||<br><br>If that makes any sense at all <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20200514093017im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/wtf.gif" alt="WTF" border="0"><br></div>Yes! Noted! I just imagined that step one would be not having it move through terrain, then step two would be making it look pretty. In my more recent implementations I&#039;ve taken away some of the homing force from the tip, and distributed it more evenly along the segments, and it looks a bit better I think.<br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200514093017/https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.msg1101619#msg1101619">Quote from: Caspar2000 on January 19, 2015, 01:39:50 PM</a></div><div class="quote">The tentacle still looks a bit weird because a) the kraken always knows where slugcat is, even when in a tunnel and out of sight and b) because it moves its tentacles as if it had infinite strenght. I could imagine, if it would only have strong lower tentacles and slower upper tentacles it would first slam the whole tantacle in the general direction of the slugcat and than the tip of the tentacle would slowly &quot;crawl&quot; the rest of the way.=D<br></div>The tentacle has no idea where the slugcat is or even that it exists, I&#039;m providing path goals with the mouse??<br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200514093017/https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.msg1101658#msg1101658">Quote from: SolarLune on January 19, 2015, 03:49:56 PM</a></div><div class="quote">Wow, that looks really great. Like, seriously, haha.<br><br>I think the only thing you might want to do is reverse how the tentacle is moving toward the goal position - instead of attempting to move the tip to the desired position, it seems like it&#039;d be easier to move the root of the tentacle to the desired root point of the path, and then move on to the next node in the tentacle. Repeat until all nodes of the tentacle are close enough to the goal. That way, you won&#039;t have so much weird &quot;ghosting through objects&quot; and doubling back on the tip, since it&#039;s going from the root forward. <br><br>But I dunno, that might be what you&#039;ve tried already, or maybe it won&#039;t work well.<br><br>Great work, anyway!<br></div><br>This is pretty much the movement pattern of the &quot;ghost tentacle&quot;. Problem is that if you move the tentacle base, you have to start the process over again. I need to account for simultaneously moving base and tip here&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20200514093017im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/whome.gif" alt="Who, Me?" border="0">

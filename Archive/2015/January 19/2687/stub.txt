I just can&#039;t seem to make it work properly... And it&#039;s extremely cognitively exhausting all the time. I really thought I was on the final stretch this morning, but that&#039;s 6 hours ago and I&#039;m still not happy with what I have.<br><br>If anybody has some tutorial, or some tips, or some anything, please please let me know!<br><br>This is what I&#039;m attempting to accomplish: Basically super rudimentary rope physics. If the rope sweeps over an island of terrain, it shouldn&#039;t be allowed to pass through. The segments of the rope should not be allowed to exist on different sides of a wall - basically the entire rope should be connected in non-solid tiles from start to end. <br><br>What I have is <i>almost </i>good enough. In some situations it actually looks okay. In some situations when the tentacle moves around an obstacle it moves so quickly that it looks as if it&#039;s sweeping right through, which kind of defeats the purpose.<br><br>Functionally it&#039;s pretty solid, it&#039;s finding paths and have a fixed reach etc. But cosmetically I find it unappealing, the movement is super jerky. Any tips or links welcome.

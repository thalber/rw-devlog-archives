<b>Update 498</b><br><br>New creature! This one is the &quot;scavenger&quot;, an intelligent creature that will play a part in the narrative that we won&#039;t spoil - however I&#039;ll share the development of the animation with your guys. <br><br>Here are some sketches. We&#039;re aiming for something along the lines of the central one standing next to the slugcat.<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308164108im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/12/17/rkul5.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Here&#039;s what we have so far:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308164108im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/12/17/qLEZV.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>This one is a knuckle walker, a type of locomotion I haven&#039;t done before so that should be interesting. Another challenge is that this creature is native to the Garbage Waste region (though it will appear in other places as well) which has some difficult terrain. Generally it&#039;s easiest for the creatures to move on flat floors, where they can build momentum in an easy linear direction that is aligned to the tile matrix. Garbage wastes however is mostly slopes, which is a bit harder to work with.<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308164108im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/12/17/6PWlU.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>I&#039;m tackling this one by fetching a few stretch of a few tiles from the path finder rather than just the next tile to go to, and then I try to smoothen that a little bit.<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308164108im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/12/17/vTSzx.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Still not completely effortless, but better than if it went tile by tile on the ground! From here I will try to make it swing its body a little more back and forth, so I later can hook up the arms to that movement and have it approach the movement of a monkey where both hands are placed on the ground and the body swung forward between them.

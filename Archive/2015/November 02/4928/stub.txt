DATE/YEAR PRESUMED, MIGHT BE WRONG

<b>Update 495</b><br><br>Gotten started on the new region. Where the previous one was laaaaaaarge with lots and lots of different sub-regions and creature sets, some of which were weird and kept secret, this one is going to be smaller and less internally varied, but in return way stranger. Like, really really turning a lot of things about the standard rain world formula upside down. Basically we want to take everything you think you know about the world and switch it around in this region, where slugcat is far out on thin ice. Within the stylistic confines of the project of course, it&#039;s not going to become a text heavy interactive novel or anything like that &nbsp;<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20151104044801im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/no-no.gif" alt="No No NO" border="0"> <br><br>As the region will be considerably smaller than the previous one, we expect to move through it a lot quicker even though it will have these strange elements and new mechanics. We&#039;re going for an economic approach where we want to get as much strange player experience as possible out of the work we put in. One day of work in it looks hopeful - we already have a mechanic in that we hope will surprise you guys and make the region stand out. <br><br>Sorry to continue keeping the lid on! We&#039;re almost through, and then we&#039;ll get back to normal devlogging and let you guys come along through the final stretch. Hang in there!

The segments move in at intervals that&#039;s a bit randomized, to give it some variety as you&#039;ll see this one a lot.<br><br>Futile is not rendering my pixel art pixel-perfectly, which annoys me. At the edges of the sprites it picks up color from the 0% alpha pixels outside of the sprite, and blends that in with the color that&#039;s supposed to be visible. Also the sprite edges flicker when the sprites move. Oh well, PAX is coming up and I better keep moving. I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll be able to sort it out later.

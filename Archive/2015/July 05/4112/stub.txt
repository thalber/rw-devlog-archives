For each sub-species there are 5 audio triggers that can be used to give different individuals a randomized voice. On top of that they randomize a specific pitch and some other variables from their ID seed. Each lizard gets a &quot;phrase&quot; - a sequence of pitches and volumes - and the sounds it actually makes are combinations of a few pre-set phrases that depend on context, and this own individual identity phrase. For example, when reacting to a noise that the lizard doesn&#039;t know the source of, it will make a sound that pitches up slightly towards the end to signify surprise or curiosity. That would be the curiosity pre-set phrase, and it&#039;s blended with the lizard&#039;s individual phrase to determine the final sound. <br><br>The idea behind this is that the combination of a randomized sound trigger (basically a selection out of 5 samples) and these pitch and volume modulations will make each lizard sound a little bit unique, while at the same time making it so that the experienced player might get a bit of a clue as to what&#039;s going on from hearing the sound. <br><br>It seems to be working pretty well ~ it definitely needs some tuning, but the technicalities are basically in. When two pink lizards have one of their dominance battles you can (or at least I can, haha!) differentiate two different voices creaking at each other.

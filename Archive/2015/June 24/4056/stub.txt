In the actual game the fish needs to take in water to spray out water, I just gave it infinite water for the sake of the gif. Remember that what you see here is generally tailored to show off the technical progress, not to indicate the canon of the game. So assume that the game will not work like what you see in the gifs, but if you&#039;re curios feel free to ask!

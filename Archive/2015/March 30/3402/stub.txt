If you want to credit it, my name is Kirk.</div><br>posted! liked and re-tweeted by many :D <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150401072923/https://twitter.com/RainWorldGame/status/582716976407175169" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/RainWorldGame/status/582716976407175169</a><br><br>New kickstarter update posted, if anyone is interested in a summary of the past months progress: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150401072923/https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/rain-world/project-rain-world/posts/1183701" target="_blank">https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/rain-world/project-rain-world/posts/1183701</a><br><br>kickstarter&#039;s handling of gifs seems to have really gone down the drain in the last overhaul im sad to say. the new UI is pretty bad too. worse than before if thats even possible :/<br><br>Things have been a little slow in level land. trying to get the new editor up and running was some fits and starts, but looks like the bugs have been worked out and 2x2s are on the menu. Joar made some good progress with the prop editor as well, and early test images with it seem to suggest that a lot is possible that wasnt before.&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150401072923im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/hand-metal-r.gif" alt="Hand Metal Right" border="0"> <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150401072923im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/hand-metal-r.gif" alt="Hand Metal Right" border="0"> <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150401072923im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/hand-metal-r.gif" alt="Hand Metal Right" border="0"><br><br>also we talked out a new creature that had been needed for Sky Islands that im pretty excited about, but i&#039;ll let him fill you in and show off demos when hes on <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150401072923im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0"><br><br>

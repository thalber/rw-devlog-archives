Thanks thanks! Backer creature list is looking good too, 60%-ish with some of the worst ones behind us <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308162138im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0"><br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308162138/https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?PHPSESSID=ltktk41vf9bf5h17ko1a26mk45&amp;topic=25183.msg1166065#msg1166065">Quote from: ProgramGamer on August 05, 2015, 05:11:07 AM</a></div><div class="quote">Those mushrooms are called &quot;vesse de loup&quot; in french.

It was modeled after that species ~ in swedish we call them &quot;smoke mushroom&quot;, but puffball is definitely better! I suspect this is a case of co-evolution where the mushroom has adapted to the adolescent homo sapiens&#039; scientifically proven preference for kicking things that are round and white on grassy fields. Seems to be a european thing though, James claims not to have been massacring these when he was 10, and if you&#039;re 10 and not massacring these that means they don&#039;t exist on your continent.

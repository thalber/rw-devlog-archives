<b>Update 413</b><br><br>Cicadas skinned!<br><br>An insane amount of work went in to this, and I&#039;m pretty much done, but probably not entirely done. We have folding wings, grabbing tentacles, etc etc etc ...<br><br>Interacting with player:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308154549im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/04/10/vJhCA.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Hanging out:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308154549im_/https://giant.gfycat.com/NegligibleRequiredFairyfly.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>The cicadas are the only RW creature so far that is explicitly gendered. I won&#039;t decide on which is male and which is female, but they come in two varietys, let&#039;s call them gender A and gender B. A colony has about 50/50 of them, unless we decide to change that because of game balance stuff. A are white and a bit larger, and stay to protect the colony during a cycle. They&#039;ll hunt bats that are stupid enough to actually enter the cicada hive, but won&#039;t go out of their way. B are black and a bit smaller, these are the ones that migrate to bat swarming areas to catch food. These are likely the ones you&#039;ll encounter first, as they occur out and about contrary to just inside the hive.<br><br>Slow motion flying:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308154549im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/04/10/OijYd.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Parts of the cosmetics are individual as usual, one of those factors are wing length, where I think I might have gone a bit over board - some have huge wings and some tiny. I&#039;ll tighten up the bell curve a bit there. Some of them have a busted wing as well, which will just hang passively.<br><br>Cicada jumping:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308154549im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/04/10/QGJIV.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>The player actually holds on to two of the tentacles haha!<br><br>And a bonus one, white lizard catching a cicada:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308154549im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/04/10/0kGi7.gif" alt="" border="0">

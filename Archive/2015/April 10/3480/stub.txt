The adrenaline charges up automatically the closer a predator is. That way you get an audio-visual cue that you have a charge, are also able to trigger adrenaline mode during a more hectic situation, and the mode replicates the kind of tension the player is likely to be feeling. You&#039;ve mentioned having the music tied to &quot;threat level&quot; - perhaps this could work a similar way?<br></div><br>This seems intuitive, but it&#039;d still require some sort of button press from the player right? In that case, why not have the ability to trigger available at all times?<br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308154549/https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?PHPSESSID=s2d04ijnjq19d9m588h2a778p5&amp;topic=25183.msg1127995#msg1127995">Quote from: tortoiseandcrow on April 09, 2015, 10:22:54 AM</a></div><div class="quote">Though I&#039;m all for having a purely diegetic UI, I&#039;m inclined to agree, now that how many bats you eat means two different things (unless you don&#039;t necessarily care if the player knows exactly how many charges they have left). Perhaps a menu button that brings up a HUD with the two rows of dots? That way checking your status is a deliberate action to pause the game and take stock, rather than being part of your ongoing experience.<br></div><br>Yeah, as the game is getting more complex it&#039;s more and more difficult to keep UI out while keeping it understandable. Two rows of dots would do a lot, and as you say they wouldn&#039;t have to be on-screen at all times. Don&#039;t want to add buttons, but you could for example make it so that UI only appears after standing still a second, or when something changes (bat caught, lost etc).<br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308154549/https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?PHPSESSID=s2d04ijnjq19d9m588h2a778p5&amp;topic=25183.msg1127953#msg1127953">Quote from: Crispy75 on April 09, 2015, 08:40:08 AM</a></div><div class="quote">If no. of bats eaten = no. of adrenaline boosts available, then at this point I think you have to have some UI to keep track of things. Even if it&#039;s just two rows of dots. It&#039;s too much information to communicate indirectly.<br></div><br>Another possibility is that you get more adrenaline time the more bats you eat, but upon triggering the adrenaline you always use them all... We&#039;re going to have to try out a few configurations and see what works.<br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308154549/https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?PHPSESSID=s2d04ijnjq19d9m588h2a778p5&amp;topic=25183.msg1128245#msg1128245">Quote from: plauk on April 10, 2015, 06:17:20 AM</a></div><div class="quote">Oh oh oh... or, if you protect a lizard from enough creatures, it would not just become neutral, but would actively befriend you, and protect you from other creatures.

Once I get around to the dynamic relationships it should be totally possible!

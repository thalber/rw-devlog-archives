The feared, the infamous, the in horror anticipated <b><i>Level Editor Overhaul</i></b> is here&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309172312im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/whome.gif" alt="Who, Me?" border="0"><br><br>Q: What is the level editor overhaul?<br>A: An attempt to make the level editor spit out rooms larger than 3 screens big. <br><br>Q: Why can&#039;t it?<br>A: Because director only has a limited memory, and as is the level editor creates a voxel build of the entire room that&#039;s 30 voxels deep. In the case of large rooms, which might be something like 1000 * 4000 pixels large, we get 1000 * 4000 * 30, and then * 4, because each layer keeps track of color for each pixel, shadow status for each pixel, and effect coloration. 1000 * 4000 * 30 * 4 pixels is more than director can handle it seems. So instead I&#039;ll try to make the level editor only render a voxel space for a little box around where the camera is for each screen, and get around those huge bitmaps.<br><br>Q: Why is it dreaded?<br>A: Because it&#039;s boring. It&#039;s a looooot of work, and digging into old code, and the end result won&#039;t be exciting at all. In actuality it <i>will </i>be exciting when the game is actually played, because it&#039;ll allow us to create really big rooms, but on screenshots you guys won&#039;t be able to notice any difference.<br><br>Q: Why now?<br>A: Because the earlier the better - James will have had access to better tools for a larger percent of dev time the earlier this gets done. Also the devlog has been dormant during my winter vacation thingie, and I figured it would be better to have it stay dormant for a while rather than wake it up and get you guys all hopeful, just to shut it down again. I won&#039;t devlog about the level editor overhaul, because it basically all boils down to &quot;In frustration I messed around with 3 years old lingo code in futile attempts to solve petty little problems in order to get to the exact same spot where the level editor already was, but this time with support for larger rooms&quot;.<br><br>Also there will be some other level editor work, such as adding a Prop Editor where James can place some objects (say plants, cogs, chains) in the environment manually instead of trying to make the randomization of the Effect Editor hit the right spot by changing the seed over and over. And make the level loader understand sub-folders, and other exciting stuff.<br><br>So, I&#039;m going to just go head first into this mess and try to survive through. Might be a couple of days!

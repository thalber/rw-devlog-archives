@Christian haha don&#039;t worry, there will be something that can eat you all by itself as well!<br><br>@adge, yep, correct! That&#039;s how I do tentacles etc, but not everything is triangle meshes. Quite a lot is also hand drawn 1-bit sprites that are rotated and stretched etc, and there is a bit of traditional animation in there as well - for example I might do a bunch of frames for a creature showing it rotated around its own axis, and then I combine that with actually rotating the sprite in code to get a 2-axis rotation. As for the engine, Unity&#039;s render pipeline and input are used, but the main loop, the game architecture (what is a room, what is terrain, etc etc) and all the object classes are my own.<br><br>@hypedupdawg, the waves are just a sine wave that&#039;s applied on top of the physics simulation :S<br><br>@Crispy75 haha let&#039;s be done before that!<br><br><b>Update 441</b><br><br>Jet fish coming along! Still no pectoral fins, but a body and some eyes. Also they sprout whiskers like carp, which are individualized. Now it looks like a tadpole/carp/squid/prawn - I&#039;m always happy when a creature takes on a style of its own and sort of leaves its real-life inspirations behind.<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309173245im_/https://giant.gfycat.com/ZestyPlayfulAlpineroadguidetigerbeetle.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>The eyes switch between underwater mode and air mode - under water they&#039;re big with a large pupil, up in the air they become like small amphibian eyes:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309173245im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/06/22/5P2DW.gif" alt="" border="0">

im torn on this too. personally, i hate the UI aspect and think it will break immersion. but on the other hand the game world is so large and complex that there needs to be some way for the player to visualize it. also, to if we are to convey destinations and locations to the player, how do we do it without a map of some sort? its either that or literally &quot;showing the way&quot; (arrows or illuminated exits) which i think would be even worse, as that removes the sense of exploration altogether. its not something that is going in right now, so we&#039;ll ponder it for a while as we go. <br><br>one thought i had was to have the map develop as you explore, but have it only be viewable from certain locations, say some sort of large map terminal in rooms connected to the region gates or something. then you can have some way of planning your route region per region and seeing where is unexplored, but its also far enough away that it doesnt have you &quot;playing the map&quot; breaking the immersion. joar doesnt like this idea and im kinda meh on it as well.<br><br>another possibility that might work similarly would be to have the map only be visible during hibernation. this solves a couple of problems actually, as for now the hibernation is sort of just &quot;there&quot; without much utility. having it be the time when you can peek at the &quot;slugcat dream map&quot; creates an added function for it, keeps immersion and doesnt interrupt the flow of the game at all, making use of a natural pause in the gameplay. the more i think of this the more i like it.

<b>Update 454</b><br>General technical housekeeping. The leviathan needs to be able to travel and hibernate in a system completely free from the normal den-and-exit framework for abstract space, which means that some new abstract node types need to be defined. This opens up for a long awaited other change as well - no more vultures through shortcuts! With this new system vultures and leviathans alike should be able to travel between rooms completely without using the usual shortcuts. <br><br>Seeing the dev interface map, James and I had another talk about in-game maps. What we would trade away is obviously the complete no-UI purity, but we would gain some pretty nice pros as well. One is of course playability, it will just be easier to navigate this huge world if you have some sort of map system to guide you - however minimal it will be a huge difference from not having any at all. The other would be vanity, haha - these environments are HUGE and very complex, but that doesn&#039;t come through very well viewing it screen by screen. A map would give an immediate visual impression of how large these regions actually are, giving more credit to all the work James has put in.<br><br>Here is a 5 minute mockup I made using a few of the HI rooms. It&#039;s put together very haphazardly and the region depicted doesn&#039;t match the screenshot behind it haha, but it might be a starting point for a conversation:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308161349im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/07/13/oMj1C.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>The idea for a map like this would be that it fills in organically as you move through the environments, and that everything is drawn as a unified shape somewhat breaking up the very distinct room-by-room nature of the game and making it feel more like a united whole.<br><br>One problem that James brought up is that in games with a map, there is a tendency that the player will end up &quot;playing the map&quot; rather than the game. I can imagine a few solutions to this, one of which would be that you can&#039;t actually move as the map is up (the controls instead pan over the map) and/or that you can place a waypoint on the map and when you then bring the map down you instead get some very small piece of UI that only guides you to the waypoint, such as a little compass or something. That way you could bring up the map, place your waypoint, and then not have to bring it up again until you&#039;ve gotten there. Basically any idea that keeps the player from having the map up all the time is game, because even if a map might be a nice aid we want the player immersed in the <i>game</i>, not the map.<br><br>Another question is what a map should look like if one is included. If it could look more &quot;slugcat instinct&quot; than &quot;computer interface&quot; that would be cool, but it still needs to be crisp and clean.<br>

Wow, loooots of interesting discussion!&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308161349im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0"><br><br>#Arrow pointing back to den: This would be really easy to implement, and maybe sufficient, or at least a great step up from nothing at all. It would basically be a breadcrumb system, but where the breadcrumbs are deleted if you double back - so if you go back and take another branch or cross your previous path the trail would just be cut at that point and then continue in whatever other direction you started off in. <br><br>#One-way rooms: If we do have a bread crumb system, a one way room will become a risk and that&#039;s kind of fine right? I imagine a rat would be hesitant to drop down a pipe or something for this very good reason.<br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308161349/https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?PHPSESSID=2hlgr6t3ktpqo7mua0d6t19qj3&amp;topic=25183.msg1158739#msg1158739">Quote from: Saijin_Naib on July 13, 2015, 08:49:51 AM</a></div><div class="quote">Map options:<br>1) No map (cleanest, most immersive)<br>2) Simple hints (highlight shader on corner of screen that points to shelter/home)<br>3) Compass hints (waypoint markers that are more discrete than the shader, but still Slugcat/world appropriate)<br>4) Fade/Memory Map (show current room&#039;s geometry fully, and &quot;simple&quot; geometry of previously explored rooms that are out of sight)<br>5) Full Map (show full geometry of current room with creatures, shortcuts/etc, show &quot;basic&quot; geometry everywhere else, show all discovered shelters/homes, show vague marker for &quot;big&quot; creatures (last time leviathan spotted, last time vulture spotted, etc), show markers for doorways/gateways/etc)<br></div><br>Nice line up! All of them except number one seems to have some UI though, so if we are going to rip that band aid, maybe try to get max value out of it and go all the way?<br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308161349/https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?PHPSESSID=2hlgr6t3ktpqo7mua0d6t19qj3&amp;topic=25183.msg1158729#msg1158729">Quote from: jamesprimate on July 13, 2015, 08:20:32 AM</a></div><div class="quote">another possibility that might work similarly would be to have the map only be visible during hibernation. this solves a couple of problems actually, as for now the hibernation is sort of just &quot;there&quot; without much utility. having it be the time when you can peek at the &quot;slugcat dream map&quot; creates an added function for it, keeps immersion and doesnt interrupt the flow of the game at all, making use of a natural pause in the gameplay. the more i think of this the more i like it.<br></div>This is also a nice idea, as it would give hibernation a sense of purpose. Maybe if you could see what swarm rooms are active in this mode (slugcat sense!) and place a marker, and then when you go out you get a compass to that marker or something? Would make for a nice &quot;planning mode&quot; similar to DF&#039;s embark screen. &quot;This is the idea, but we all know it&#039;s gonna go to chaos once we get out there.&quot;<br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308161349/https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?PHPSESSID=2hlgr6t3ktpqo7mua0d6t19qj3&amp;topic=25183.msg1158763#msg1158763">Quote from: Teod on July 13, 2015, 10:22:39 AM</a></div><div class="quote">I don&#039;t think either of those are good ideas. You either have a map or you don&#039;t. Limiting its use in any way is really annoying. I remember being infuriated by a game when if didn&#039;t let me open the map during the jump. If you want to nerf map&#039;s power - keep those nerfs within the functionality of the map itself: how much it shows and how accurate it is.<br></div>This is also a valid point. But if the hibernation mode feels very separate from the game, almost more like a between-mission menu screen, maybe you wouldn&#039;t get that frustration? Also coming home to the den and getting to see the map grow when your newly explored rooms are added could be a nice end-of-cycle reward?

From the current looks, it should eat the vulture, but lose to the sea monster (although I wonder if it would be possible to make them fight in the real game).<br></div><br>Yeah we&#039;ve been thinking about this too. It should have some way to handle creatures larger than itself. Don&#039;t have any definitive solution just yet, but maybe it can wrestle them for a bit, get a &quot;taste&quot; and then give up and leave them alone. Don&#039;t want to go too complex as this creature doesn&#039;t seem like the contemplative type, it&#039;s more like a &quot;grab and eat&quot; kind of personality.<br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309211351/https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?PHPSESSID=nutp61nhcasnbid1g5r6hrb1i2&amp;topic=25183.msg1177161#msg1177161">Quote from: Forstride on September 07, 2015, 06:37:14 PM</a></div><div class="quote">Maybe it&#039;s just me, but the bendy tentacle legs just seem kind of weird for a spider-like creature.&nbsp; When you think of a spider, you think of stiff legs with multiple joints.<br><br>I&#039;m not sure if that would be feasible with your current system, but I feel like it&#039;d look much more spider-like, and in turn, creepier.<br></div><br>This actually points out what the workflow usually goes like ~ Do you remember how the vulture was used to be called &quot;Sky Kraken&quot; way back? Basically I set out with one idea, but then it changes as the creature develops. This is what&#039;s so fun about being the programmer and the artist! I don&#039;t have to make the thing look like some sketch or some original idea, if the spider looks cooler as an octopus halfway through, I can make it an octopus <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309211351im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0"><br><br>The idea for this creature is that it&#039;s sort of both spider and spider&#039;s web.

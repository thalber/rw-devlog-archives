right now im going back into first region i did, Suburban, and touching it up. both for the new widescreen look and to bring it up to the skill level of the more recent regions. its tedious work, but man the results are worth it:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309173009im_/https://i.imgur.com/6damPmal.png" alt="" border="0"><br>detail: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309173009/https://i.imgur.com/6damPma.png" target="_blank">https://i.imgur.com/6damPma.png</a><br><br>as alpha players know, there aren&#039;t too many multiscreen rooms in that first region, so i want to make them count!

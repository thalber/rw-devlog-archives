well SOME of the clumsiness is that there is no behavior AI attached, etc etc. there is still quite a bit more to do on this beast in that regard, Joar just skinned it nicely so we could present a solid kickstarter update. Same goes for the shadow, which he whipped up in like 30 minutes after i nagged him about it XD. For that amount of time it looks damn amazing haha, but yes im sure there will be some tweaking in the near future.<br><br>@cwearly: youre not too far off actually!<br><br>@christian: thanks for the backup! <br><br>its true that we dont go too much into the narrative stuff here, but thats intentional for a few reasons: first is that there is still a lot of work before that stuff is all nailed down. We still have a few gameplay mechanics that would be essential to the current narrative concept that we havent even started exploring yet. Naturally the game is evolving while we build it, so talking about the narrative aspects when entire sections of the current plan may or may not exist doesnt make much sense. <br><br>Also is that from my perspective, I really want people to go into the game fresh. (Yes, even you Chris!) For us, Rain World is a mood piece, and the experience that we are trying to create is that of a lost creature in a strange world. We DONT want you to know some things, thats the whole point <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309172601im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0"> Joar and I were actually just having a conversation about this, where at some point we&#039;ll be at that weird point where we&#039;ll have to start choosing what to devlog about so as not to spoil too much. Probably not for a little while yet though!<br><br>Occasionally we get the physic simulator comments, and that makes sense as a HUGE part of the work that Joar is doing (literally the entire past year) is building the game engine, which is... basically a tricked out rain world physics simulator. If you are used to seeing games done from prefabbed dev toolkits perhaps its a bit slow (and believe me, from our perspective it is infinitely worse hahah), but the result is the look and animation that &quot;is Rain World&quot; so thats what were doing, however painful and tedious it might be&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309172601im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/hand-thumbsup-r.gif" alt="Hand Thumbs Up Right" border="0">

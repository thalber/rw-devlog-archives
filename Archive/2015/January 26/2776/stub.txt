I&#039;ve kind of tried to make a world and creature designs that can roll with it though - like if things are a bit weird and uncanny it feels sort of correct, mood wise, that the creatures are clumsy and jerky and all that.<br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309172605/https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?PHPSESSID=gbm20ghn1cr7tpqkeqtgbkv3p1&amp;topic=25183.msg1103649#msg1103649">Quote from: Janeator on January 26, 2015, 05:00:04 AM</a></div><div class="quote">It looks amazing!<br>About the name, I&#039;d name it Skull Vulture or simply Vulture.<br><br>Also, I&#039;d add a few more feathers so the wings look like they can really make him fly, but that&#039;s just a small detail.<br></div><br>Yup, James and I discussed it, and we&#039;ve decided to just call it &quot;the vulture&quot;. The other creatures follow the same pattern of being named after whatever real life creature they resemble - snail, bat, leech, lizard. So it just makes sense for it to join them! Also vulture sounds kind of ominous without necessarily putting in a whole bunch of darkgrim words like Skull etc, haha. Also I think it has a kind of creepy quality when something has the name of something you know what it is, but is clearly something else&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309172605im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/whome.gif" alt="Who, Me?" border="0"><br><br>On the number of feathers, I can tease you by telling that it&#039;s literally a variable I can set, but I deliberately set it to 16-22, I think it was ~ it&#039;ll remain a mystery how it can actually fly, I guess!&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309172605im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/tongue.gif" alt="Tongue" border="0">

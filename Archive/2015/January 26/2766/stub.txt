<b>Update 387</b><br><br>Wow, that was a lot of work! But also probably the most fun I&#039;ve ever had. Since last time, the beast has gotten a head, feather like appendages on its arms, smoke coming out of the thrusters and some kind of shell on its back.<br><br>Many things still need work, such as the head and neck being too lose and floppy when it&#039;s flying, and the smoke in general. I would like to have the smoke look cooler, but I settled for this as good enough for now. My main concern was that I really wanted the smoke to be affected by the wing flaps, and I got that in even though it doesn&#039;t perhaps look all that natural. Maybe down the line I&#039;ll do a 2D grid based fluid simulation o_0<br><br>Here&#039;s the head in its classical frame animation sequence. I&#039;m getting rusty at old school animation haha! But with some help from the computer (rotating the sprites, mostly) it still looks smooth enough.<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309172605im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/01/26/x8iF3.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>And on the creature!<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309172605im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/01/26/GglBT.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>The tusks or mandibles or whatever are probably going to have some stuff going on, I imagine that they&#039;ll hang like this, but when the creature gets into Hunt Mode they retract towards the neck, and sit there in a &quot;charged&quot; position. From there they can move forward quickly in a bite, and if that gets you you&#039;re stuck. If it doesn&#039;t, however, the creature needs to retract them again before biting the next time, giving you half a second of breathing space. I think that might be necessesary in order to give you the feeling that you have some sort of chance - this way you can actually save yourself from a close encounter with a bit of skill and luck. If you&#039;re caught automatically when touching the head, the creature can just kind of cheaply sweep around and get you pretty much whatever you do.<br><br>Here&#039;s the creature taking off:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309172605im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/01/26/g8L3l.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>And an remake of the eagle landing one, now with head and all that stuff (this one took a thousand takes, because it just refused to land on the little platform... Everywhere else was preferable, apparently -_-)<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309172605im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/01/26/kh8c7.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>And last, some climbing gameplay where I manage to make the beast lose track of me. It&#039;s usually not that easy, but I was lucky this time and the tracker sent a ghost off to the right instead of up the pole. Remember that it doesn&#039;t have any AI yet, only the tracker. The AI is literally two lines that say &quot;go through the known creatures in the tracker. If they are a slugcat, tell the pathfinder to set the movement destination to where that critter is believed to be. Break the loop.&quot; Behaviour will probably look cooler once that&#039;s actually sorted out.<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309172605im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/01/26/Py3qN.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Oh and also, maybe we need a new name for this beast? Sky kraken was fun as a WIP name, but seriously, the finished product is looking distinctly not like an octopus to me. &quot;Skull Bird&quot;? &quot;Jet Beast&quot;? Suggestions?<br>

Thanks&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309172605im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/grin.gif" alt="Grin" border="0"><br><br>Also James persuaded me into implementing this one thing we&#039;ve been talking about, having the shadow of the creature as a warning of its approach :<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309172605im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/01/26/0pX4e.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>I&#039;m really happy with the result! Subtle enough, but still totally possible to notice if you&#039;re alert.<br><br>In physical reality, how things would work is that the creature would have to be like, in front of the level, behind the camera, to block the light like this. A while I was thinking about having the shadow casting creature be in another room or something, to get that. But we are awkwardly trying to make 2D and 3D work together here anyways, and sometimes the best solution is the simplest one. It struck me that what probably makes most sense from a utility perspective is that if creatures above the screen cast shadows on the level. So, maybe we&#039;ll let realism go out the window this time - just because it&#039;s such a charming detail to the actual game experience to be able to see shadows of critters above like this. And who knows, maybe when they&#039;re up there they move a bit in the z dimension to get in front of the sun, haha! Anyways, now we have this weird situation where if the creature is moving downwards, you first get the shadow, and then one screen later you get the shadow + creature. Not realistic, but it works <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309172605im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0"><br><br>Technically what&#039;s going on, is that if the creature is above the screen, all of its sprites are moved down one screen height, making it reappear in the screen rect, and colored in the &quot;shadow only&quot; color. Simple as that! So a cool thing is that every sort of animation and behavior the creature can do, the shadow can do as well.

Either I flip the shadow upside-down, which would look strange, or the wing flaps would be unaligned with the vertical movement. Honestly I think the current solution works alright despite not being realistic - it looks nice, and gets the relevant information across. Strict physics correctness isn&#039;t really the subject of my perfectionism. I&#039;m way more bummed about the shadow not affecting the first few depth layers (which you probably didn&#039;t notice until I mentioned it now) and that&#039;s the thing I kept thinking about when trying to go to sleep last night...

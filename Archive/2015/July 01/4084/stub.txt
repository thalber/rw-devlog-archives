@Keith, thank you so much :D Keep in mind that animation != gameplay though O___O<br><br>Don&#039;t worry, instead of weird chemical death you will be able to have them eaten by leeches!<br><br><b>Update 446</b><br><br>I&#039;ve been working on a water lizard, it will be salamander or axolotl-inspired in its appearance. During the day I&#039;ve been setting the creature up and dealt with the various path finding related issues that I inevitably run into. Drawing a head for the lizard took about an hour, bug hunting why the hell it wouldn&#039;t go into shortcuts under water took 2, after which I tried several fixes that didn&#039;t work, after which I applied a 5 minute fix that I feel like, in the back of my mind, that it might break the vulture. Hahaha. Inheritance is great for the fact that if you solve a problem in one place, you solve it in all of them. The backside however is that if you solve a problem for one of the inheriting classes, you might break something for another one. We&#039;ll see what happens. <br><br>It&#039;s strange how much more time I spend messing with my damn technical issues rather than adding content, and maybe not a good thing. But what to do? I have to get it to work, one way or another. Anyway, now it can enter the shortcut and I&#039;ll try to get some cool swimming animation running ~

Yeah, maybe in the water it could work. This has come up a few times and I&#039;ve been pretty obstinate towards the idea because we have these super static, pre-rendered backgrounds with plants and everything in them, and those are a very base component of the game that&#039;s not gonna change. If the entire environment is super static, including plants, but there are <i>some </i>plants that moves, that would bring even more attention to the static nature of everything else. For that reason I&#039;m doing a strict division in the artwork: creatures move, plants and environments stay still. However, in the water there is already the water shader that slowly wobbles the entire picture, so there it might actually be game to do something like that. As you say though, actually filling one of those rooms completely with physics-based seaweed isn&#039;t really viable. However it would perhaps be possible to further use the visual obstruction of the water to make some magic happen with shaders or similar.

The second GIF there, it looks like they are stretching. They don&#039;t really look like the kind of plant to do that.

I think there is a certain appeal in them for me. What are the odds of maybe having a setting to turn off the wavering shadows and fog and such?

It&#039;s kind of in the nature of a plant not to be able to move and grab stuff after all! As for the shader stuff, yeah there will likely be some graphics settings to turn the effects down or off. I recognize that we have lost a certain quality that the older, more lo-fi look had, but we&#039;ve been gaining a lot of other qualities in exchange!

It&#039;s mainly sticky and slows you down:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309173355im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/07/21/gxNyh.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>However, if you really get stuck in it, it can actually eat you:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309173355im_/https://giant.gfycat.com/SeriousAmazingCheetah.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Basically, the higher speed you keep the less dangerous it will be. If you jump and roll, or even just run at a good pace, it won&#039;t get you, but if you slow down it can get a grip, and then you get slower, and more worms latch on, etc... <br>

I&#039;d actually disagree. From a screenshot it looks like the darkness is just boring and you don&#039;t see anything, but in-game the entire thrill is moving around and only being able to map out the geometry one piece of a time. It feels like a nice mystery exploration situation, and that would be ruined if you lit the rooms or placed a lot of glowing things that could be used as reference points. I think the dark areas are going to be way better in-game than on screen shots, but let&#039;s keep it that way as it&#039;s otherwise officially known that Rain World is best in gifs... so let&#039;s let the poor actual game have something going for it&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308155639im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/cheesy.gif" alt="Cheesy" border="0"><br><br>Icky darkness creature is starting to be done. Christian&#039;s super gross gifs are on to something, but I won&#039;t give too much away ~ The behavior and the skin is done, now to make it work in the connected world. This thing is horrifying! It hates light though, so when you go down there, grab a lantern mouse and run as fast as you can!<br>

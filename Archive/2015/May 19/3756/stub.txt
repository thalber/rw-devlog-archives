Probably! or at least 2 of the 3. Right now were scrambling to get together a build for E3, so audio is taking a back seat for a week or so. <br><br>and regarding this creature... not to overhype it or anything, but damn it is LITERALLY my nightmare. as in, i was telling Joar what i hated most in the universe, and... then he goes and sketches it and builds an even more horrifying version in game. *shudders*<br><br>not sure if ive ever seen something like this done from a technical standpoint either. pretty cool, pretty cool.

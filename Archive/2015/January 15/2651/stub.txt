since Joar is all wrapped up in tentacle/code hell, ill drop some screenies from the wrap up of the Heavy Industry region:<br><br>a little transition aesthetically towards the Garbage Dump<br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309172343im_/https://i.imgur.com/tlz7oW8.png" alt="" border="0"><br>detail: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309172343/https://i.imgur.com/7rT5WVi.png" target="_blank">https://i.imgur.com/7rT5WVi.png</a><br><br>and this one transitions directly into the next region, Chimney Canopy<br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309172343im_/https://i.imgur.com/z63cZOO.png" alt="" border="0"><br>detail: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309172343/https://i.imgur.com/CogqqMo.png" target="_blank">https://i.imgur.com/CogqqMo.png</a><br><br>over the past few days ive been finishing up the rooms, getting the whole region connected and placing creature dens. one big aspect of this region is that unlike the last two that we did, this one lizards totally run the show. they have access to everywhere here, so it was the first real test of the large scale terrarium AI vibe and... im actually super impressed right off the bat. <br><br>Whereas the previous regions were more room to room (intentionally) and platformy, this one finally we get to see Joar&#039;s AI work in action with multiple lizard breeds churning, fighting, snapping at each other while chaotically chasing you all over the map. it is DANG fun, and hopefully just a glimpse at things to come!

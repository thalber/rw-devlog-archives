<b>Update 381</b><br>Tentacle Hell sounds gross/exciting depending on your preferences, but is actually just standard tedious, fun, demanding programming work. I feel in my element, and am at the same time not sure if I can do it. A nice challenge! After wasting half a day trying a proper physics engine solution that ended up glitching in infinity I decided to try something else, and am now doing the tentacles in tile space instead of float space, with the intention to overlay them with float space physics later. We&#039;ll see how it goes. Still nothing much to show, though progress is steady, so no gif yet. Hopefully I&#039;ll have some images for you tomorrow! Grabbing tentacles seems totally viable, although I think this critter might use them mainly for locomotion. But by this point I&#039;ve spent so much time on tentacle code that if this actually does work out, we&#039;ll definitely explore some other tentacle critter down the line. Will see how it pans out though, maybe sky kraken ends up grabby as well!

This is sort of exactly the intention: when you first encounter creatures they are terrifying, but as you learn their individual behaviors, they can become an asset.<br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309172343/https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?PHPSESSID=nm0e340q1kq8gmicni4vuhm154&amp;topic=25183.msg1099958#msg1099958">Quote from: Christian on January 14, 2015, 09:30:40 AM</a></div><div class="quote">My only concern with a flying predator is that I kind of feel it might be overpowered compared to the slugcat. I mean, you&#039;re already feel outgunned and outnumbered with the lizards but there you can use your agility to outmaneuver them. A flying creature seems like it would negate the advantage your agility provides. How do you escape something like that?<br></div><br>Flying creatures will have a massive advantage in certain terrains thats for sure, but will be unable to go through tunnels and tight spaces. Basically once you are below ground they arent really a threat. Lizards have much more terrain in common with the slugcat, so the more dangerous of the lizard breeds should actually be way more overpowered than the sky kraken, at least in terms of relative danger to the player. <br><br>I mean, to clarify: this creature itself will be a complete terror. Sky Kraken is supposed to be Death From Above. But were thinking that clever level design and some as-of-yet unmentioned game mechanics will be the determining factor in keeping it manageable.

Thank you! Yeah this one is certainly venturing into some more alien territory. It&#039;s also pretty technically ambitious, even more than the lizard animation-wise, but it doesn&#039;t have the multiple breeds like the lizard does so it should be a bit easier to handle. I don&#039;t really have a solution for the devlog spoiler issue, as I kind of use the devlog as a tool for my personal motivation as well - if my progress is recorded somewhere else than just on my own computer it feels more like I&#039;m moving forward...<br><br><b>Update 380</b><br>Started setting up the framework for creature codename SKY KRAKEN. There&#039;s a creature template and all that now, as well as an actual physical representation that can move around a room with path finding. Everything is as usual just slightly more complex than what I can hold in my head at a time, but by breaking the problems down I keep getting around them. This time around I&#039;m also making a little &quot;setting up a creature instruction manual&quot;, which will hopefully speed up the process later by keeping me from doing stupid mistakes like spending 15 minutes debugging why the critter is just lying there, until I realize that I didn&#039;t spawn the AI module, etc.<br><br>The tentacles will need some physics fiddling. Currently we have lizard tails, but those are completely limp and only 7 segments or so. These tentacles will be way bigger, and as they&#039;re not purely cosmetic they&#039;re going to need to be a little bit more robust in their terrain interaction. It can&#039;t be hand waved that two segments end up on opposite sides of a wall and the like. So now I&#039;m doing a thing where each segment is forcefully kept in the line of sight of the previous one - no terrain can be in between them. I&#039;m veering into Actual Physics Engine stuff here, and I&#039;m a complete amateur, so wish me luck lol! We&#039;ll see how it goes, worst case I&#039;ll have to simplify stuff a bit to get around the physics issues.

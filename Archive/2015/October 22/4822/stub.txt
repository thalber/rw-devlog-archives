So, I have been playing, and maybe it is just me, but I kinda liked the low fps/jerkiness of the early alpha, (or at least I think I would, based on the footage I have seen). This may not be everyone, but the slugcat&#039;s movement doesn&#039;t feel very animal, if you know what I mean. I tested this theory out with an fps limiter, and while visually it wasn&#039;t a huge improvement, it <i>felt</i> better somehow. Maybe you know what I am talking about. Or maybe those little visual details, like it scrambling to get up a ledge to a platform, (in that slugcat life video I think). It lasted less than a second, but it is little details like that I am talking about. All of this is freaking amazing, don&#039;t get me wrong, but remember the little details too... Speaking of which, what about the shelters? I remember that alpha video with the pups, where it was those huge industrial doors. Someone earlier brought this up, saying how the current one looks like it was specifically designed for the slugcat. Maybe have some big ones, with little nooks and crannies inside to sleep in?<br><br>TL:DR where are all those things from the alpha videos?<br></div><br>Yeah, there are certain qualities of the alpha that are lost, but I think that&#039;s pretty much to be expected when you re-build from the ground up! However there are quite a lot of things that are significantly better with this new build, so it evens out haha ~<br><br>That framerate thing you mentioned I&#039;ve noticed as well. The lingo build was supposed to run at 40 fps, but was in fact closer to 20, which was a much more forgiving environment to animate in. Have you ever been drawing a sketch, and it looks great, and then you add color and stuff and it doesn&#039;t look as good any more? The brain has a tendency to fill in missing information, actually it&#039;s often so good at it that the filler material is better than something an artist can come up with. I&#039;d say that the reason some people think the lingo alpha had more animal-like animation is because it had a loooot lower framerate, and because you know it&#039;s supposed to be animals you fill in that missing info with your own animal stuff (one example is that many people have mentioned seeing the slugcat claw at a ledge to get up - a behavior I have in fact never specifically implemented). <br><br>All the creatures in the new build have more sophisticated animation than any critter in the lingo alpha, but the framerate is also way higher which makes any imperfect movement more obvious. Another thing that plays into this is that the slugcat itself was the very first creature I animated for the unity build, and is also the one you look at all the time. So the slugcat will definitely get some polish before release. I have been contemplating capping the frame rate, but at the end of the day I don&#039;t think it would be worth it. Obscuring the art to make mistakes less obvious feels wrong, and is generally not very effective at the end of the day, as any illustrator who has tried to save a bad drawing with filters or blur knows. The higher framerate creates a more professional and smooth presentation for the entire game, and it keeps me on edge as an animator!<br><br>As for the shelters, the original concept was that the region gates and the shelters would be one and the same - but as the regions got absurdly huge that idea had to go. However, the &quot;art idea&quot; still lives on in the current region gates:<br><br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309211400/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/05/11/gtc4f.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309211400im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/05/11/gtc4f.png" alt="" width="400" height="227" border="0"></a>

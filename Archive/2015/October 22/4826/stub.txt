#local frame cap, this idea is quite strange to me <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309211400im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/shocked.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0"> So basically you&#039;re talking about that the <i>movement</i> of the sprite on the screen should be smooth, but the movement <i>within</i> the sprite should be framy? I guess it would sort of make sense coming from a classical animation pipeline where you draw each pose for a character - just having it switch image every second frame but updating the position of the sprite every frame. For me though I doubt it would be possible, as at the end of the day my animations are basically <i>only </i>positions, no image swapping... Like, most of my creatures consist of 2-10 &quot;chunks&quot; with a position each, and sometimes hundreds of cosmetic little details each with a position and velocity, so there&#039;d be no way to pick one of them and decide that &quot;this one is the real position of the creature&quot;.<br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309211400/https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?PHPSESSID=u1tpdhif9fllkja1kd59839ve7&amp;topic=25183.msg1191461#msg1191461">Quote from: Schoq on October 22, 2015, 08:14:55 AM</a></div><div class="quote">I&#039;m irrationally frustrated about not being able to see this new creature and area!<br></div> <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309211400im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/eyebrows.gif" alt="Well, hello there!" border="0"> There is like, 4 times the content of a standard region in there, and there&#039;s more to come!

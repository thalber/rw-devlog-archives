Segmented or plain? (All colors just mockups, tentacles will be procedural but I just drew something in there to get a feel for it, no wings yet)<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308154128im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/04/08/15Vb2.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>The segmented looks cool, but the RW art style is a lot about flat colors. Also the finer aspects of the pixel art will likely get pretty mashed when things start to rotate...

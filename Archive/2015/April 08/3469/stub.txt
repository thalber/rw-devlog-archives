It&#039;s a common &quot;charge&quot; button in platformer games, and visually It could be like a cat tightening its muscles and arching its back, readying itself to pounce. It would still need some way to let the player know clearly when and if the adrenaline rush is available. Simply not allowing the slugcat to enter such a &quot;ready&quot; state might be a bit confusing to players.<br></div>Yep, was thinking along those lines as well. There could be a sound while holding the button that increases in pitch or something, so you hear that some sort of charging is going on, and then a sound cue when you actually reach the adrenaline stuff. I have a bit of a palette change when in adrenaline mode, the palette is desaturated a bit, so you should be able to understand when it has actually happened.<br><br>Problem is that you&#039;d most likely want to activate it in the middle of a hectic situation where you don&#039;t have the time to sit down for 2 seconds. That <i>could</i> be an interesting risk/reward factor perhaps, you have to try to estimate if the situation will be dangerous and activate the adrenaline before going in. However I don&#039;t want it to be frustrating because you feel that you waste all of your charges and never get to use them when you&#039;d actually want to.<br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308154352/https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.msg1127705#msg1127705">Quote from: Teod on April 08, 2015, 02:09:49 PM</a></div><div class="quote">I disagree. I think the fall should continue as long as the <i>jump</i> button pressed.

Bees etc all look the same, if they had their individual patterns they wouldn&#039;t really look like social insects, more like a haphazard band of bandits. That would be really cool for the yellow lizards though, which are also lizards so it&#039;ll come really easily. For these I think subtle color and size variations will probably be enough. Also... I&#039;ve got to get a move on&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308154352im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/whome.gif" alt="Who, Me?" border="0"><br><br>I&#039;ve drawn it in 9 angles now, and think it&#039;s looking quite good:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308154352im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/04/09/LXwht.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Smaller than you think looking at it in scale 1:1!<br><br>I think I&#039;m gonna roll plain, they already have quite a lot going on visually towards the bottom of the shape, and the wings will fold up over the body when sitting to add some interesting stuff there as well. RW&#039;s art style is heavily dependent on flat color surfaces, so I don&#039;t want to do too much with patterns etc on small critters like this or the pixels will become jumbled. For a larger creature like the vulture that would be really cool though - when doing the individual stuff for the vulture I&#039;ll def look into some random patterns.<br><br>

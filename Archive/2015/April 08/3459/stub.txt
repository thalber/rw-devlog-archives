Hm, 3 votes for plain, 3 for segmented... Maybe some more subtle pattern instead? The segmentation looks cool, but is a tad too visually busy in my opinion. I&#039;ll experiment with third options. Some changing pattern would be cool, but this is a pretty small creature that I don&#039;t know if it could make it justice, better do that on some larger beastie. Also I have some other plans for shader stuff with this one, and don&#039;t want to go totally overboard with the shaders.<br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308154128/https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?PHPSESSID=ptcrs15o3ua7001cvea66phoa4&amp;topic=25183.msg1127603#msg1127603">Quote from: Christian on April 08, 2015, 09:13:07 AM</a></div><div class="quote">Also will there be any co-op only moves?<br></div>Interesting idea!<br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308154128/https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?PHPSESSID=ptcrs15o3ua7001cvea66phoa4&amp;topic=25183.msg1127616#msg1127616">Quote from: theEasternDragon on April 08, 2015, 09:48:53 AM</a></div><div class="quote">So, just a brief suggestion.

If I remember correctly, zebras have their stripes so the hordes turns into visual noise right?

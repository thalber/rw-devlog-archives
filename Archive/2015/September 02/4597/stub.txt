Lizards can eat bats now?<br></div><br>Sure, but not too much more to tell yet. Joar has had the framework for this system in for quite a while actually, and the effects can be seen currently in the behaviors of the cicadas and the jetfish. But its one of those numbers things that&#039;s probably going to require a bit of fussing with and balancing to make it work well, so we will get into that more when we&#039;re in the polish phase, where the world is complete, creatures are done and we have this big ecosystem web of creature behaviors to mess with. I think it should be pretty fun! Really looking forward to what Joar can do with it&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308162607im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0"><br><br>As for your other question: so far lizards don&#039;t really eat bats (though they might snap at them from time to time.) Did I say something otherwise in the interview?

Yeah, that&#039;s the idea! Violence as a messy last resort when everything else fails - never a goal in its own right.<br><br><b>Update 469</b><br><br>More daddy long legs work. The locomotion still has some wonks, but it&#039;s getting better. This creature has a new challenge - it&#039;s more procedural than most because this time around the body shape and the amount/length of the tentacles are randomized as well, not only cosmetic details. This introduces the difficulty of not knowing exactly what the body I&#039;m writing locomotion code for will look like, but at the end of the day the general body plan is always similar enough for it to work - chunky body in the middle, halo of tentacles around it.<br><br>This creature will use its tentacles to grab, and today I did some work on making it reach into narrow spaces to try to pull you out. What&#039;s tricky about this is making it able to think about how to interact with spaces it&#039;s not actually allowed in itself. The solution I&#039;m going with is to rely on the tentacle pathfinding I already have - the tentacles are sort of autonomous and just gives the main AI some hints on how to make their activities easier. This autonomy should also bring with it the ability to hunt two or more different prey with different tentacles at the same time.<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308162607im_/https://fat.gfycat.com/GiddyDefiniteBactrian.gif" alt="" border="0">

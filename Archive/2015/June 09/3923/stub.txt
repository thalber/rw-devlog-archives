You can see that the lights are &quot;environment&quot; - this means that they will pick up their color from the environment they&#039;re placed on, and &quot;Sun&quot;, this means that they understand to fade in and out with the sun. <br><br>Some lights are the same as the old light sources you&#039;ve already seen, but some lights are &quot;flat&quot;, which means that they&#039;re basically just a radial gradient rendered on top of everything looking a bit like a lens flare or a bloom effect. However they&#039;re rendered below the sunlight oversaturation shader, which makes for some interesting interactions.

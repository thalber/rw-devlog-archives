@AxezDNyde Thanks for the explanation! I have a way better understanding of what&#039;s going on now. Love this sort of devlog interactivity&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308120118im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/grin.gif" alt="Grin" border="0"> <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308120118im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/hand-shake-r.gif" alt="Hand Shake Right" border="0"><br><br>The *= .99 was actually added by me, for exactly the reason you mention <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308120118im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0"> I know the solution could be more slimmed, but actually the code I posted here was cleaned up, in my actual implementation I&#039;m saving some other stuff as well for the surface points, why I&#039;m keeping them as classes.<br><br>@Prinsessa, looking good! Really interesting to see how you use a different method to achieve a similar result. When you&#039;re done tinkering I&#039;m sure we&#039;re all eager to know the result, <i>is Gabe a witch? </i>&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308120118im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/whome.gif" alt="Who, Me?" border="0"><br><br><b>Update 402</b><br><br>Lizard infighting! This has taken the entire day, but I think I&#039;m getting somewhere. The actual animation, i.e. how the lizards move, still needs polish, but the more general behavior seems solid enough. <br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308120118im_/https://giant.gfycat.com/UntidyImmediateAmurminnow.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Basically it goes like this - the lizards have an AgressiveRival relationship towards each other, of varying intensity. They&#039;re mostly aggressive towards others of the same breed. As they move around, they can get annoyed with each other, because of various reasons. If they&#039;re very aggressive, just because the other is too close, otherwise in situations such as the other being too close to the prey they&#039;re hunting, and in particular when they bump into each other and block each others&#039; path.<br><br>If the annoyance goes high enough so that it&#039;s picked by the utility comparer, a Fight behavior is initiated. As this is mostly a display of dominance it&#039;s not really as much fighting as hissing, but if they end up in a narrow space it might get ugly. <br><br>When fighting, the lizard has a chance each frame to to send out a signal. I&#039;ve set up a rudimentary system for inter-lizard communication, right now there are only two types of signals Aggressive and Submissive. The angrier the lizard is, the more Agressive signals it&#039;s sending to the other. On receiving an Aggressive signal, the receiving lizard&#039;s annoyance is also incremented, making it more likely to return the Aggressive signals, and that way the conflict escalates. However, there&#039;s also a small chance upon receiving an Aggressive signal to return a Submissive signal.<br><br>When a lizard sends a Submissive signal, the conflict is de-escalated, and the submissive individual gets tasked with leaving the room. For this I had to set up a new AI module called Mission Tracker, which will come in handy for a lot of stuff. The Mission Tracker can basically keep track of a bunch of tasks an AI entity has set out to do, such as travelling somewhere, or maybe in the future to hunt down a specific individual, search a specific room, or similar. The Mission has a utility, and if something happens to the lizard with a higher utility the mission can be dormant for a while, and then continued later. This means that now a lizard can for example be headed somewhere, but be interrupted by a threat, flee for a little while, and then when it&#039;s safe continue its Mission.<br><br>At the moment there&#039;s just one Mission implemented, which is to get out of a room. When the mission is activated a neighboring room is chosen, and the lizard starts to move there. Actually it tries to move two rooms away if possible, which will scatter the lizards all over the world to James&#039; delight haha! James is generally trying to shape the play experience with level design, but my unpredictable critters tend to get in the way of that&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308120118im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/cheesy.gif" alt="Cheesy" border="0"> Maybe if it&#039;s too crazy I&#039;ll have to take a step back on that.<br><br>Anyhow, all of this basically boils down to a pretty simple behavior - the lizards will hang out, but occasionally get annoyed with each other, do a lot of hissing and maybe a little fighting, until one of them decides to scram with its tail between its legs. Hope this interactivity will make the game feel more dynamic and fun.

Oh yes!<br><br><b>Update 451</b><br><br>Progress coming along nicely! First a moody one with the water, showing what this beast will mostly look like in the actual game. Swim slugcat swim!<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308161200im_/https://giant.gfycat.com/LeanForcefulDutchshepherddog.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>This next one represents about the maximum amount of the creature you&#039;ll see in the actual game - the water is my friend here, because it&#039;s super hard to do the psuedo-3D stuff I usually implement on this scale, so everything being obscured by the water is a godsend. The idea is that never quite seeing the creature in its entirety will both make it feel ominous and also allow me to cut some much needed corners in the animation.<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308161200im_/https://giant.gfycat.com/EquatorialCleanHind.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Here&#039;s a slow motion gif of what I&#039;ve got for the mouth parts so far:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308161200im_/https://fat.gfycat.com/SparklingScratchyBaldeagle.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>I think it&#039;s an interesting visual contrast that the entire thing is some sort of soft mushy kelp-grub, but the mouth parts are straight up heavy duty industrial machinery. It also serves a gameplay purpose - in the monochrome underwater environment the dangerous mouth parts need to be somehow distinct from the rest of the creature. If everything was just billowing tentacles you&#039;d not be able to understand what part it was eating you with, it&#039;d just feel like sometimes touching it randomly kills you.&nbsp; Hopefully this will provide a visual contrast that works even in monochrome; squishy parts - not so dangerous, square parts - very dangerous.<br><br>Currently my plan is that the mouth will extend to the position where both jaws are parallel but slightly apart. There it will pause for a little while, before very forcefully with an almost instant movement smash together, and then pull into the head again. Anything that had the bad luck of being in the square-ish area between the jaws at that particular frame gets pulled in with it. Once retracted, the jaws will glide outward towards the resting position again.

So happy people are enjoying the game&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150831161545im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/grin.gif" alt="Grin" border="0"><br><br>@prinsessa, The game has creepy elements, but we don&#039;t want to go all out horror!<br><br>@Teod, Yup, we&#039;re totally aware of the promo material situation! It&#039;s just that it&#039;s just the two of us, and we&#039;re all caught up in making content atm. When we finish the map up (soon) we&#039;ll probably need to get a grip and make an effort in those areas.<br><br><b>Update 467</b><br><br>Tube worms!<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150831161545im_/http://giant.gfycat.com/MasculineFlickeringAndeancat.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>(Sorry about the gif artifacts!)<br><br>These guys shoot a mucus rubber slime tongue thing at a wall or a pole, tube along it, retract it, and shoot it somewhere else. Sometimes they hit a creature passing by, or each other - it can end up a pretty tangled mess.<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150831161545im_/http://giant.gfycat.com/PinkSpotlessButterfly.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>If you catch a creature with it and then release it, it will continue to dangle from the creature but try to attach to terrain with the other end. This means it can be used to restrain creatures - In two player mode with my cousin we&#039;ve had a lot of fun trying to tie down a vulture with a bunch of these, as well as creating horrible tangled messes with for example a vulture, a lizard, three worms and the other player in a katamari ball of despair.

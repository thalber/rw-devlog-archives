<div class="quoteheader">Quote from: Princessa</div><div class="quote"> will it be possible to play the game without killing stuff and eating bats? Again, if not, please consider. </div><br>Most of the fundamental mechanics of Rain World are built around the core idea of the player creature being at the center of an ecological triangle as both predator and prey. Through that we&#039;re able to explore the concept of resource scarcity on a micro and macro scale through the narrative design, the world design and down through the gameplay, etc. What happens when an ecology of creatures (or civilizations) are forced to compete for a pool of dwindling resources in a world with a climate dangerously out of whack? I want the player to feel the existential pressures of this, the bleak prospect of comfort and even survival slipping further and further out of reach as time goes by, not through &quot;enemies&quot; or &quot;bad guys&quot; but only due to the consequences of the player characters basic needs for survival and the natural self-preservation behaviors of those around it. For me, thats the thesis of the game and something i feel very strongly about conveying, for reasons that should be fairly obvious.<br><br>That said, I really like the idea of the game not forcing a players hand, allowing the game to be playable in a variety of ways provided they fit the criteria of the central game mechanics of &quot;get sufficient food&quot; and &quot;survive rain cycle&quot;. These are &quot;emergent narrative paths&quot; that open up based on how the player naturally approaches the game and i&#039;d like to support and encourage them where possible. &quot;Vegan Slugcat&quot; is hard because it compromises a good deal of teh structure already in place, but if things work out in a certain way it could *possibly* be explored as an achievement path later in the polish phase. But other than the necessary sustenance it should currently def be possible to get through the game as a pacifist using entirely stealth and misdirection. In fact, Joar even has a system in place to reward altruistic behavior, though we&#039;ll keep quiet on the specifics of it for now. <br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150831160950/http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.msg1173051#msg1173051">Quote from: tortoiseandcrow on August 26, 2015, 12:12:34 pm</a></div><div class="quote">Note: from my experience of the alpha, it is entirely possible to play the game without purposelessly killing other animals. In fact, it is appropriately difficult (often impossible) to just run around murdering all of the predators hunting you.<br></div><br>This is def a key element as well. Its not fleshed out yet, but there is also a system in place where the more aggressively you play, the more aggressive the creatures around you become. If you kill weaker creatures, it opens up their ecological niche to other more dangerous creatures, etc. Plays to both the thesis of the game and creates a challenging &quot;warrior&quot; emergent narrative path, etx etx.<br><br>A lot of this stuff is really &quot;balance focused&quot;, so nothing were touching right now and very subject to change. Plenty of work to do just getting the core game and geography in place.

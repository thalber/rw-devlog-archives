@fizmat, that idea of a potential pause or at least slight dial back of the death rain is kinda interesting! I&#039;ll try it out!<br><br>@Teod, yeah I think so too, today I implemented some &quot;inside&quot; rain, or maybe rather &quot;in front&quot; rain, I prefer to just call it &quot;everywhere&quot; rain haha. It looks good in an open level, but I&#039;ll have to come up with something else for rooms that are, say, more or less underground but with a skylight where there should be rainfall.<br><br>@oldblood thank you &nbsp;<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309173127im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/grin.gif" alt="Grin" border="0"> Yeah this doesn&#039;t make sense at all. Also I think that the terminal velocity of falling water isn&#039;t all that high, so I doubt you can get a fire-hydrant sort of effect from rain even if you have a lot of water. But, this is art here - I try to chose my moments when to attempt at things making sense and when to go with more weird expressionistic stuff, and this is definitely the latter.<br><br>@tortoiseandcrow, I think there will be a lot of flash floods, as there are a lot of underground and underground-ish rooms, but I don&#039;t want to flash flood <i>everything</i>. If you get flooded while you&#039;re all the way up in a Sky Islands antenna that&#039;d mean that there is an entire ocean coming and going with each cycle, and that&#039;s more hyperbole than I can sign up for &nbsp;<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309173127im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/cheesy.gif" alt="Cheesy" border="0"><br><br>@darklight, welcome! I might attempt something like it, but it would be quite difficult. As RW has lots of fluid animations it wouldn&#039;t really do to have some square stuff going on for the water, it would be super Jarring, so if I do try to get water washing around it would be ~~~coooomplicated~~~<br><br>@Gimym JIMBERT, Christian, Woodledude, Nope, I have not actual fluid dynamics running. The water fall is just a square with a shader. The water in the game does have a water <i>surface </i>simulation running, but that is a very specific thing where it is assumed that the surface is just a curve in 2D space with water below it and air above it. Actual fluid dynamics where the water can go all over would be something completely different. I haven&#039;t really seen many examples in 2D (or 3D) games, McMillen&#039;s &quot;Spewer&quot; would be the exception. But if the water were to match the other water stuff visually I&#039;d have to go crazy with shaders on top of it, and doubt the computer would be able to do millions of water particles all interacting and then the shader stuff on top. Granted, it is CPU and GPU so the burden would be split, but for the GPU I&#039;d have to work with blurring and render textures etc (on top of grab passes) so I really think it&#039;d be too much there, aaaaand the CPU would most likely not be able to handle the amount of particles I&#039;d need to be happy either (which would be about 600 times more than in Spewer). So, if anything I think I&#039;m gonna fake it some other way.<br><br>@Osteel, hi, welcome! On Rain World is James, who posted right above you there, and me! Feel free to hang around and talk, we&#039;re really nerdy and technical but if you&#039;re into that sort of stuff we&#039;re happy to answer questions etc &nbsp;<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309173127im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/hand-thumbsup-r.gif" alt="Hand Thumbs Up Right" border="0">

<b>Update 429</b><br><br>More rain stuff! First of all, fixed the splashing through walls. But mostly I made the shader able to fade between different rain intensities, and added physical interactions for the rain.<br><br>First, very light rain:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309173127im_/https://fat.gfycat.com/UnequaledFancyBandicoot.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>If performance permits I can imagine rain at this intensity come and go a bit during normal play, it could even look pretty good with the sunlight out. But it&#039;s an entire new grab pass, so idk, I&#039;ll see if that works.<br><br>Heavy rain:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309173127im_/https://giant.gfycat.com/AdeptSpotlessBobolink.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>This is what I imagine to be the equivalent of very intense real-world rain. It still doesn&#039;t cause your locomotion any trouble as you can see from the pole climb, but it assumedly makes you wet and cold.<br><br>Grade A death rain:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309173127im_/https://giant.gfycat.com/BossyPhonyGuineafowl.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Possible to move through, and it doesn&#039;t outright kill you, but certain movements such as jumping and climbing are really hard as you&#039;re constantly pushed down. If you&#039;re under a roof you&#039;re not affected at all though.<br><br>Grade B death rain:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309173127im_/https://giant.gfycat.com/WigglyAggravatingEstuarinecrocodile.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Unless you have a completely covered route to the shelter you&#039;re in trouble now. It&#039;s still possible to move through, but you have limited control and are violently pushed out at the sides and thrown around in the middle. You need some horizontal momentum to go through it, so the charge jump might help you out. This rain should also kill you, although I haven&#039;t implemented that yet. I think it&#039;ll be a counter that goes down while you&#039;re in the rain, which has a constant ticking and is also decreased when you&#039;re pounded into the floor. If you&#039;re under cover you&#039;re still free to move, but in most situations you&#039;re probably done for by now.<br><br>Grade C death rain:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309173127im_/https://giant.gfycat.com/PowerfulIllegalKillifish.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>From here it&#039;s basically a death screen. You gradually lose control where ever you are, and everything fades to rain mayhem.<br><br>Oh, also, I just divided these into different &quot;grades&quot; for the sake of showing it off, in the game they exist as a smooth continuum. Also I realized looking at the gifs that the grades A and B look very similar despite having different effects, so I&#039;m tuning that now.<br><br>Now to hook these up to some sort of progression that happens naturally in the game!

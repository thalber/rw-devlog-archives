impending real deal death rain will have other significant tells as well, creatures hide, the screen darkens, the palette changes, etc etc., so shouldnt be that confusing to have some occasional dynamic light rain. plus, the player SHOULD be nervous about the rain! the initial reaction you describe is exactly the idea! the rain should be this constant looming existential threat, and im hoping that even as the player gets deeper into the game and understands the mechanics, the dynamic light rain instills a sense of dread, double checking to see if the other tells are there, etc. And if/when it fades out, a huge sense of relief is felt. thats the idea at least!<br><br><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">I&#039;m a little confused because I seem some regulars posting like they work on it, yet other times post like they&#039;re seeing udpates for the first time.</div><br>we live on opposite sides of the planet, so you are right: sometimes the first time actually seeing some element implemented is on TIGS! works just as well as slack or basecamp (more reliable in some ways), and way more fun too <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309173127im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0">

Diving into a bit of sound stuff - trigger placement, adjustments etc, so might be a little quiet here for a day or two. Basically we&#039;re setting up a powerful infra structure for sound randomization, so the aural experience is going to be really organic. Taking a look in the sfx folder today I noticed that James has SIXTEEN (16!) sounds for the backflip jump, and similar amounts for most other player movements. Minor co-stars such as the snail has to make do with meager 8-12 variation on most of its sound effects though, so don&#039;t expect too much&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308155515im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/shocked.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0"> And this is when he had to manually input each variation, now I&#039;ve made an interface for him where the system will automatically detect a bunch of sound effects with the same name and make a pool for random selection out o them. Who knows what craziness might come out of that!<br><br>We also need more sound triggers placed, for example the vulture is silent as a ghost atm, and lantern mice and a few other things also need to have their triggers placed.

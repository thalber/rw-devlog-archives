Thank you thank you thank you&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308163532im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0"><br><br>I agree with your input - square back plates and synchronized movement is now part of the design.<br><br><b>Update 493</b><br><br>Rare rain world action gif! <br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308163532im_/https://giant.gfycat.com/IndolentImpoliteCirriped.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Didn&#039;t really plan on it, but RNG threw down two spears in the room and then survival instinct kicked in. This is the sort of violence I&#039;s ideally like for the game to have - short bursts of action, and the violence never being a goal in itself but slugcat also not hesitating to use it if it&#039;s the only way to survive a situation. <br><br>As you can see that medium sized centipede manages to attach itself to my lower body for a little while there (will be less confusing with a sound cue), which brings up a detail about how the creature works. They kill you with electricity, and need to attach both ends to form a full circuit. The bigger ones are more effective at it, and can use their weight to restrain you more during this phase. With the smaller ones you have a little bit more of a window to do something, as can be seen in the gif.<br><br>James and I had a talk and decided that further on as we do some brushing up on the damage system there might be a few more factors making them more dangerous the larger they are - maybe the smaller ones will have to zap you multiple times, for example. With wildly varying sizes like this the danger should vary with the size, so that those huge buggers are just as dangerous as they look!

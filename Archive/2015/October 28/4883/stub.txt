playin this centipede build, and WOOOOOOW it is seriously something else. i have a high grossness threshold (from playing years of this game), but running through a dark hallway with 7 of those beasties skittering around is straight up shudder-inducing. from a design perspective its super effective, because you *REALLY* dont want to see the slugcat get grabbed by one of those nasty things, if just for purely emotional reasons&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308163622im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/shocked.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0"><br><br>also, i know the bar is set pretty high but... im thinking this thing might be the best animated creature in the game. Which is pretty impressive considering everything else. What do you guys think? Amazing work Joar!<br><br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308163622/https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?PHPSESSID=0c5dmm0u7vs59b451hcd948fn3&amp;topic=25183.msg1193242#msg1193242">Quote from: Jimym GIMBERT on October 28, 2015, 01:54:49 PM</a></div><div class="quote">please!<br><br>PLEASE!<br><br>In the PR material and ads, put &quot;procedural animation&quot; upfront! it&#039;s the buzzword of the moment and it can send huge shock ripple into promoting more experimentation in that area<br><br></div><br><br>oh most definitely. we are going to buzzword the *hell* out of the pr stuff.

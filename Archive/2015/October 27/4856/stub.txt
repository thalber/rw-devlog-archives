<b>Update 492</b><br><br>Work still in progress, but now we&#039;re starting to see where it&#039;s going!<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308163509im_/https://giant.gfycat.com/HorribleTatteredCurlew.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>The very variable size is fun, but I&#039;m unsure about whether it will stay - just too little control for James when he places them if they can vary like that. Maybe they could be split into a large and a small one, and we basically get two creatures for free. First though, the skin needs to be finished. As is the entire creature is just square sprites - now I need to do some art work for the shells, legs etc.

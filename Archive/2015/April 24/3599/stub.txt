@Christian, thanks! Size-wise it makes a lot of sense for lizards to be hunting them, so yeah I think so. The sketch was more me drawing a bunch of creatures on the same page and failing to crop the lizard out tho&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309162318im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0"><br><br>@Prinsessa, yeah, they&#039;re a bit spidery now that you mention it! Everything I make becomes creepy... These will be more cute than creepy though, this particular backer is a friend and it has been made clear that the cuteness is <i>not </i>to be compromised!<br><br>@Crispy75, Actually they can&#039;t climb walls, they have to have a corridor leading up there, or they can hang from a ledge. Those corridors up top in the gif are connected to a chute that leads to the ground, where they scurry up. They should also theoretically be able to suspend from horizontal poles, but I haven&#039;t tried that yet.<br><br>@oldblood, thanks thanks! I&#039;m really happy myself about how well the backer creatures are fitting in, it would be dishonest to not say I was worried as the suggestions came from a pretty motley bunch of angles and takes on what the game was about. I did sweat a bit over the backer creatures, but by now I&#039;ve actually turned around 180 and view them as an asset rather than an obligation. Working with other peoples&#039; ideas has turned out to be a really cool boost to the creativity, and I definitely think the cast will be more diverse for it. Also, all of them so far has really been working out really well aesthetically and thematically.<br><br>Other news: Yay, simple rope physics working-ish! The simulation is really crude and can only really deal with pretty calm movements or the rope will start sticking to corners everywhere, but it works for mellow dangling from the ceiling. I capped it at 2 bends, when the rope is bent the third time it snaps, as another anti-tangling measure. If I decided to go there, this could easily be a very similar hell to the tentacle stuff, and I&#039;m sooo done with that, so I think I&#039;m gonna call it a day. My main goal was to make them able to swing a little back and forth, because I want to show off the dynamic shadows. <br><br>Behavior-wise these critters are pretty simple, they just have an idle (dangling) and a fleeing behavior which is more or less&nbsp; straight imported from the ThreatTracker module. They don&#039;t need a specific hunt behavior as the idle doubles as this - they&#039;ll wait passively for a bat to be lured astray among the pretty lights. What needs to be done is that they should be way less concerned about predators that are below them while they&#039;re suspended, as it wouldn&#039;t really make sense for them to spot something coming along the floor and then panic and drop down there - playing it cool and hanging out is smarter. If a predator is above them however, they should probably be more concerned.

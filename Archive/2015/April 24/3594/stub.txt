Ewwwww &gt;___&lt;<br><br><b>Update 417</b><br><br>New creature on the way! This is a backer suggestion as well - the lantern mouse. The lantern mouse is a creature smaller than you that is mouse-like and glows. It lives in the dark regions, and hang from the ceilings trying to attract flies with its glow. They work as a light source in the dark regions, and if you&#039;re skillful you can catch one and carry it with you in the same somewhat awkward manner you can carry a cicada or a snail. <br><br>I&#039;ve already got some path finding and general behavior up and running, yay modular AI!<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309162318im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/04/24/USWi5.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Sooo, hanging from the ceiling... At first I thought I was going to be able to skip all the rope physics stuff, and just have it lose it&#039;s thread(tail? Spider web? Well, the dangly thing) if the thread hit terrain. However, it turned out that the rope hits terrain ALL the time, especially as these fellas are not wall climbers and therefor actually have to secure their ropes somewhere close to terrain. So, rope physics it is. <br><br>I&#039;m not doing anything super fancy, just want something like the ninja rope in worms - basically whenever it hits a corner that corner becomes the new attachment coordinate until the previous attachment coordinate is visible again. Slowly but surely I&#039;m getting there, through horrible hacks:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309162318im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/04/24/ZKavq.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>As you can see I&#039;m about halfway there - the sentiment is right, but at this point it can only keep track of one corner, when it hits a new corner it promptly forgets about the previous ones. I don&#039;t think this will be <i>too </i>difficult though, I&#039;ll just keep a list of the corners and de-activate them as they come into sight again. But let&#039;s see!<br><br>Really happy to be back to game-making again&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309162318im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0"> <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309162318im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/hand-thumbsup-r.gif" alt="Hand Thumbs Up Right" border="0"><br>

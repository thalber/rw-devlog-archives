And i know that room, its CC_A08! Even specific tile work is there! Speaking as the person who made that room, i could not be happier. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308163344im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/tearsofjoy.gif" alt="Tears of Joy" border="0"> <br><br>Since Joar and I are busy with... well, everything... we&#039;ve asked her to just go wild for a bit and spend some time getting style ideas down, trying out concepts, etc. Considering this is her first proper attempt and its already awesome, im pretty dang excited to see how things develop from here. Ill post a follow up when she finishes it, ofc.

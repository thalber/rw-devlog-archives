<b>Update 393</b><br><br>Doing the actual promised &quot;roaming of the skies&quot; now. That essentially means moving the vulture around through abstract space at semi-random until it comes upon something, like the player. The vulture stays a little bit in each room before moving on, which in the case of realized rooms is usually spent on the edge of the room or slightly outside it. So you can actually see the shadow of one of them sweep by and be successful in hiding, in which case it&#039;ll move on to the next room.<br><br>I think that when sound goes in, it could be pretty nice to have some sound cue when they enter the room, so you get a chance to scurry under cover.<br><br>Technically the vulture is able to &quot;teleport&quot; from anywhere to anywhere, but I&#039;ve tried to cluster the prey search a little bit. Essentially it works like this - it picks the room it&#039;s in, and searches it. Then it searches the neighboring rooms (as connected by actual connections, if you count sky highway all rooms are &quot;neighbors&quot;) and search them in a random order. When done, it repeats this process - but this time current room will be one of the neighbors. So, that way it&#039;ll vacuum the environment at semi-random, and hopefully there&#039;ll be a feel that it &quot;is in an area&quot; rather than wildly teleporting around.<br><br>There is a 1/10 chance though that it&#039;ll just take off to any sky accessible room, to mix stuff up a little bit.<br><br>As the vulture is a beast performance wise, I think I&#039;ll also add some kind of inter-species grumpyness to them. Two of them can run simultaneously on my computer, but when three are tentacling around it can get a little framy, so having them prefer not to all hang out in the same spot might be a good idea. <br><br>Soon James will have his hands on the first vulture build, and you guys can hear his first impressions <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309172824im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0">

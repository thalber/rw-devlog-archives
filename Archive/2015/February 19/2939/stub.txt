I think the unity tools would have been totally useful, but I tend to think that trying to work with and around &quot;user friendliness&quot; is more annoying than doing more stuff myself - which is obviously 100% personal preference. And obviously just to a certain level, I&#039;m super happy about not writing RW in assembly. I absolutely believe that everything I&#039;ve done so far would be possible to do in actual Unity, but I think I would&#039;ve been more frustrated at times haha. Not to say that frustration has been at an even zero as it is&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309172954im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/cheesy.gif" alt="Cheesy" border="0"><br><br><b>Update 398</b><br>James and I are working on a build to show at PAX, so a lot of the stuff I&#039;ve been doing is bug squashing and trying to make features already present more presentable, which is why updates are a little sparse lately.<br><br>Today I did however do some fun stuff! A few of the old special moves made it back:<br><br>This is the skid - if you run a while in one direction and then change direction the slugcat slides a little. The gif really couldn&#039;t capture it, here it just looks like some droplets, but the actual feeling when you play is rather prominent. I guess some sort of intimate eye-hand interaction has to be at play which doesn&#039;t really come across if you&#039;re not playing what you&#039;re seeing. Anyways...<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309172954im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/02/19/nxTPb.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>If you jump while skidding, you get the backflip:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309172954im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/02/19/O5Qwu.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Which is cool for obvious reasons&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309172954im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/cool.gif" alt="Cool" border="0"><br><br>Then there&#039;s the roll, which is achieved by holding down + a direction when hitting the ground. Doing the roll saves you from that little stun that can happen when falling from higher altitudes, and gives you a little speed boost in the direction you want to go. You have some control over how many times the slugcat rolls by holding the down key - if you release early you get just one roll, otherwise you get two or even three.<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309172954im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/02/19/zPad.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>You need some height to get the roll, you can&#039;t do it from just jumping on a flat floor.<br><br>Jumping out of the roll makes for a special jump, where the slugcat flies like an arrow through the air.<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309172954im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/02/19/NHnO.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Depending on how long you maintain the roll, this jump acts a little differently. You could say that it&#039;s charged by the roll, so there&#039;s an interesting dynamic at play: You want to maintain the roll longer to get a more powerful jump, but if you wait too long the roll is exited and you get no jump at all.<br><br>The backflip ties in with the roll, meaning that from a backflip jump you can get the roll even if you&#039;re not falling from high up. This means that all of the moves I added today can be chained together, which looks pretty cool:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309172954im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/02/19/BIcEo.gif" alt="" border="0">

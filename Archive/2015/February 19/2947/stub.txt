There will be a few more moves definitely, but not too many. The game should be about using a limited set of moves to maneuver creatively, not about memorizing a huge library.<br><br><b>Update 399</b><br><br>An old friend is back!<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308151901im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/02/19/SpQ9.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>I have a decent implementation of the white lizard in now. The camouflage is working, and the different - way more passive - AI is running as well. Neither is top notch yet, but pretty functional.<br><br>I was thinking about doing the camouflage as some super high-tech shader, and I&#039;m still considering an implementation like that, but... Actually I&#039;m pretty fond of the flat color silhouette. It fits in with the art style better than shader madness, and actually it provides a pretty perfect amount of actual camouflage for gameplay purposes in my opinion. So, maybe I&#039;ll leave it like this for now at least. <br><br>For those of you who haven&#039;t read this devlog for years and years, the lizards come in different colors with some different traits. The white one is a chameleon that sits and waits instead of pursuing you.

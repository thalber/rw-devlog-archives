Nah we don&#039;t have 700 rooms yet, but now the forecast is looking like we&#039;ll break through that, and 1000 might not be entirely impossible either if James keeps this pace O___O <br><br>But keep in mind that strictly we are counting <i>screens </i>here, not rooms - which makes comparisons a bit difficult. In Knytt a screen is a room I remember correctly, so there the comparison makes sense, but shadow complex is a side scroller where each room is several screens large right, so then the comparison falls apart. Back in suburban region I think the average room was something like 1.2 screens (almost every room was a one-screener with a few two- or three-screeners) but in this latest region I&#039;d say that the number has gone up to something crazy like 3.5 screens per room on average or similar. So despite being waaaay larger than SU I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if it actually had fewer <i>rooms</i>.

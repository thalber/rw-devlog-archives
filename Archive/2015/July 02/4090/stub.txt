Yellows! I hope so. Seems like something that will go well in the next region actually.<br><br>So ive been quiet the past week or so, mostly because this Shoreline region that im working on has become all-consuming. Im finishing it up now, and minus the narrative-specific rooms that we&#039;ll be adding in later, its already over 100 screens... which is a little over 3x the size of the Suburban region. So its *huge*.<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308161138im_/https://i.imgur.com/YeNx87ul.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>That said, it might actually be the tightest region conceptually, and im super happy with how it is turning out. The game mechanic possibilities of open water swimming was just too good to not explore in depth, and that we certainly have! Plus, you can&#039;t imply the scale of &quot;ocean&quot; without some serious scope, right?

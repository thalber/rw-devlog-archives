i mean the results so far are pretty dang good from our perspective, but took like a solid 8 months or something of Joar slaving over it to it get it up and running and honestly is still ongoing process. &quot;port&quot; is probably the wrong word really, more like &quot;complete engine rebuild/upgrade/re-imagining&quot;. but hey were pretty happy with how its turning out so &#175;\_(&#12484;)_/&#175;

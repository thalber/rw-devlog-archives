kind of a deep question! <br><br>as far as the rain world look, if you check out the first pages of the devlog... thats the look: 2d, refined pixel art-esque combination of 20x20 sprites and physic simulation animation in a layered diorama style environment. thats what caught peoples interest and thats what they backed on kickstarter and thats what got us a publishing deal. so we couldnt very well switch over to something like vanilla unity, which is a straight up 3d engine, and do a totally different looking / playing game. <br><br>even for &quot;2d style games&quot;, unity just places a camera to the side of a 3d environment, using 3d meshes for textures, creatures and environments. it wouldnt work at all for the per-pixel animation style that Joar does. so yeah, the pixel art aspect, but also everything else about the look and engine really. we would have had to make an entirely different game from scratch and everyone would have hated us, so again praise be to Matt Rix, hallowed be his name! we get to use all of the original development tool kit that Joar developed for the lingo build: level editor, tiles, geometries, etc etc, and just place it into a modern game context, which is pretty dang amazing.<br><br>you might then ask &quot;why port at all?&quot;, and the answer to that is the old programming language that was used for the original build (lingo) isnt compatible with modern systems/platforms/etc and just wasn&#039;t capable of the scope of the game we wanted to make. SO... 8 months of hell. But hey, here we are!

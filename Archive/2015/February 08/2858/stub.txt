What about PS4 and PS3? The initial Adult Swim announcement mentioned “PSN, PS Vita, and well beyond”. Just curious if that means consoles as well.

There is a bunch of big console news coming up, but that&#039;s all Adult Swim publisher business stuff to announce when they have it all worked out. We&#039;re just focused on building the damn thing! <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309172801im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0">

thanks to all!&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309172801im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/gentleman.gif" alt="Gentleman" border="0"> of course we win the award then immediately disappear for a few days. *real nice devlog guys*<br><br>quite a bit of progress IS happening, but much of it is finicky stuff or un-breaking things that you would think would already be working, but Joar seems to be hacking his way through that list pretty steadily, so fingers crossed.<br><br>on the level front, i just put together the world file for the 4th region, Chimney Canopy, which was a tricky endeavor. The CC region is situated between 3 other distinct regions and had a bunch strong ideas we wanted to explore, both visually and geometry-wise. Plus the Vulture came out so strong that we wanted to dedicate some serious space to that. Trying to make all these components work together and have a coherent look/feel was quite a challenge! <br><br>Early in the game world planning stage, this region was to have around 15 screens, but as it is put together now it has 59(!!!) bringing the total number of screens for the first 4 regions to 192(!!!!), or close to what I had assumed would be for the entire game&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309172801im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/cry.gif" alt="Cry" border="0"> That said, I think Joar and I both agree this region is the the strongest yet, and its really fun to play. From my perspective the larger the world the better, so I&#039;m thinking its worth all the time spent banging my head against the wall! No one will ever say that Rain World is light on content.<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309172801im_/https://i.imgur.com/mXRZquol.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309172801im_/https://i.imgur.com/JYMzPwil.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309172801im_/https://i.imgur.com/YlYFNvAl.png" alt="" border="0">

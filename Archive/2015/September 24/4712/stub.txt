Hi there&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308163203im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/grin.gif" alt="Grin" border="0"><br><br><b>Update 480</b><br><br>The goose chase continues!<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308163203im_/https://fat.gfycat.com/PlayfulRegularAbyssiniangroundhornbill.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Still a bit of details to go, but we&#039;re getting there. The pixelly plumage is WIP (the idea is that there&#039;ll be a bit of variation there as with the lizards/jet fish etc), and the legs will need some more work as well, along with the eye, so... basically a little bit of work on everything until this beast is done.<br><br>The environment in the gif is brightened to help you see, this is actually a sub-region of Shadow Urban, meaning that it&#039;s supposed to be too dark to navigate unless you have a light source.<br>

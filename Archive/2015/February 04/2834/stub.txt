Hmmmm.... That sounds similar to the Dijkstra maps I&#039;ve got going! In most situations I think directions can be derived from asking the neighbors about their values, and don&#039;t need to be saved in their own right, but in more complex cases I can totally see it. With visibility for example - saving which direction the visibility &quot;comes from&quot; could be used to have an NPC guard in a sensible direction in a shooter (facing out towards the landscape, not in towards a corner). Haven&#039;t really come across much stuff like that though, the single dimension data has been working just fine.<br><br><b>Update 392</b><br>Ugh, path finding. A solution to yesterday&#039;s problem was to check along the edge and picking the tile with the freshest path, then using that one as &quot;start&quot;. <br><br>By today I have the inter-room paths generate somewhat reliably, and the critter can also follow them. It all works out except that some kind of ghost of yesterday&#039;s problem lives on, sometimes the creature can&#039;t find its way into the map. This is the part that should be <i>simple&nbsp; </i><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309172748im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/tired.gif" alt="Tired" border="0"> <br><br>I think it&#039;ll be possible to do some ugly hack though, and by now I really feel like it. Maybe just force the creature to move towards the map if the destination point is inside the map, no matter what.<br><br>Once that&#039;s figured out, there remains one thing - having the abstract path finder be able to go by the sky highways as well. That shouldn&#039;t be too bad, but you really never know. Hope we&#039;ll be out of this marsh by tomorrow.

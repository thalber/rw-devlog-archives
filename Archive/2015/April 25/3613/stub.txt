Valid concern! I&#039;m the one to write the code that outputs these, <i>and </i>I&#039;ve drawn the palette, so I&#039;m really not one to speak, but to me it&#039;s decently obvious what is the first - interactive - layer. The dark stuff that connects to the room borders is solid, the light grey stuff is background. Perhaps seeing it in motion helps a little bit as well, as the clouds sort of give away what&#039;s deeper into the image, but that might be wishful thinking. However I&#039;m pretty sure that the interactivity of the game helps out a lot - if you&#039;re a bit unsure about whether something is interactive terrain you can try, and because the rooms are composed of assets you&#039;ll recognize and know that asset the next time. This should obviously not be the main way of differentiation, you should be able to do it at a glance, but it&#039;s a fallback. <br><br>The simpler and cleaner the geometries and tiles, the easier I imagine the terrain is to read. And that&#039;s certainly a concern in the messy garbage wastes. However I think James has been doing a good job with dumming the geometries down a bit for this region. Most regions have some pretty intricate maze stuff going on, here it&#039;s mostly just flat floors or large distinctive hills with the occasional garbage-sickle sticking up, and after interacting with one of those once I had a pretty solid idea how they work. But then again, this is a dev talking... The contrast though, which is the main way of communicating this, is changeable in the palette, and that&#039;s really easy. So if it&#039;s a problem I&#039;m sure we&#039;ll be able to adjust it!

Thanks!<br><br>And yeah, what James says, actually releasing and selling the game feels like in a long long time in a galaxy far far away - for now the story is on a more personal plane about finishing what you set out to do!<br><br>@marcgfx, stuff isn&#039;t really bats and mice etc, they&#039;re not even named those things in the game - we just need to have some descriptor for them to refer to them in the devlog! So, the internal relationships between the critters don&#039;t have much to do with those of the real-life creatures they lend their names from.<br><br>All these mice are super cute! Nice to see some cute in this thread, there&#039;s been plenty dark grim and creepy to go around haha.<br><br>James yeessss you just keep cranking out the pretty with this region! Really digging that black fungus tree!&nbsp;<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308154944im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/grin.gif" alt="Grin" border="0">

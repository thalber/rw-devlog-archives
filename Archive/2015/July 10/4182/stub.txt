Thank you everyone! Glad you like it&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308161349im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/grin.gif" alt="Grin" border="0"> Still a bit of work on this one, but now it will be mostly AI stuff.<br><br><b>Update 453</b><br><br>The next waypoint is making this beast swim between rooms, but the &quot;map&quot; we had (colored squares, you might remember) got broken in the region connection project which would make it very hard to know if I had managed to make it roam the world, haha! So the question was, make a new map or fix the old one? As the old one basically didn&#039;t work - it was just colored squares and to check if two rooms were connected you had to search for squares of the same color hahaha - I decided to go with a new map. This new map gives soo much overview compared to anything we&#039;ve had up till now, feels really good to watch the little creatures move around in abstract space!<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308161349im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/07/10/Xjdct.png" alt="" border="0"><br>(Note that this is not some canonical arrangement for the region - how the rooms are located relative to each other you&#039;ll have to ask James about, this is just me pulling them into some configuration where I can see them.)<br><br>On top of this I actually got the leviathan swimming between rooms ~ but it&#039;s not completely finished yet. It can use this &quot;sea highway&quot; as we call it to teleport between rooms if swimming off-screen, but it also needs an AI behavior that tells it to do so. I imagine this working pretty much exactly as the vulture; it will slowly roam the region, if arriving in a room where there are edible creatures it&#039;ll make a quick detour into that room.

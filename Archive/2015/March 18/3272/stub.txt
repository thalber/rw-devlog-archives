Is that a thing you&#039;d feel comfortable sharing with folks as of yet?<br></div><br>thanks! ill still be in &quot;level building super crunch mode&quot; for the next little while yet, but as it happens i was just showing Joar a bit of my process at PAX, so i have a kind of cool little progression on deck that i can show you guys!<br><br>Early in rain world days, when the game had more of a simple cartoon look, i was kind of skirting the chiptune style to match the 16bit graphics and platformer vibe. That was mostly low bit synthesis like pulsewave modulation (on physical soundchips, naturally), additive/subtractive synthesis, white noise and some formant or wavetable synthesis for more vowel like growls and grunts and such. Sounds cool but is BORING AS HECK to show because its literally just me sitting in my basement messing with some waveforms for hours and then writing a track with it. <br><br>As the game has developed into a deeper, more rich (and more procedural!) visual experience, ive been working a lot more with manipulating &quot;junk audio&quot;, and that can be more dramatic to show, because you can hear each step. This track was written more just to show Joar the possibilities with this one technique, but the track wound up turning out pretty well! Should be perfect for a certain weird subterranean region... anyway, heres how it went:<br><br>Literally me recording us talking at the PAX booth and showing him the soundwave loading:<br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308153113/https://clyp.it/obyjx1dg" target="_blank">https://clyp.it/obyjx1dg</a><br><br>The same sample pitched down for effect and to create better material to grab from:<br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308153113/https://clyp.it/udnp13qu" target="_blank">https://clyp.it/udnp13qu</a><br><br>Selecting audio points in that sample to capture from, i do this weird semi-randomized arpeggiated thing:<br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308153113/https://clyp.it/ddlxzmds" target="_blank">https://clyp.it/ddlxzmds</a><br><br>And from there the track takes shape. Adding percussion and other instruments (many of them also taken from that same audio clip, manipulated to suit my ends through sample and hold techniques or whatever):<br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308153113/https://clyp.it/v2v2et5r" target="_blank">https://clyp.it/v2v2et5r</a><br><br>I kind of dont like showing tracks outside of the context of the game, because this is just one piece of the audio puzzle, but imagine something like this fading in and out, blended with wind, rain, atmospheric and creature noises and you&#039;ll sorta get the drift!

oh of course! ive been planning this moment for like 3 years, so pleeeenty of cool tricks lined up for the audio&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150626232308im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/eyebrows.gif" alt="Well, hello there!" border="0"><br><br>if you guys havent already, take a read through the early devlog talking about audio parts of the old lingo build, which used a procedural approach to audio event triggering even then. one of my favorite bits was for the lizard growls and shrieks. I did a bunch of audio for each breed at various &quot;threat levels&quot; varying in intensity and character, then Joar took those waveforms and wrote a function that matched the actual lizard jaw movement to the physical shape of the sound wave. <br><br>depending on what was going on with that particular lizards AI (taking into account whether it was hunting/idle/frustrated/hurt etc.) the audio would play procedurally selected clips taken from that breeds threat level audio samples, so the result is lizard audio that fits the AI mood and actions of the moment, was never the same twice and each sound lined up with the lizards actions and animation. <br><br>thats suuuper cool stuff to play with and im really excited to do more now that we have a more robust sound engine! we want to take a similarly dynamic approach to ambient and weather audio as well. Ideally each region will have a pile of characteristic ambient audio separated into songs, weather sounds, atmospheric stuff, etc., and depending on things like rain cycle position and game narrative, these elements will get blended into a unique soundscape for that moment. If we have enough time to do it right, the player might never hear the same soundscape twice. Right now i have about 75 &quot;songs&quot; written for the soundtrack not&nbsp; including ambient or atmospheric stuff, so i definitely think its possible!

Isn&#039;t it goddamn genius you guys&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308153113im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/tearsofjoy.gif" alt="Tears of Joy" border="0"> The last batch of tracks I got from James was all weird stuff, and all of it freaking fantastic, although in different ways. There&#039;s one long track which is somehow constantly out of sync with itself while at the same time managing to sound distinctly musical, which keeps you on the edge of your seat by never being quite predictable. And others are strange and beautiful in ways I can&#039;t really describe as I&#039;m music illiterate, but yeah, all awesome stuff. I really really really can&#039;t wait to get sound running just because of the soundtrack aspect - just playing the game with the soundtrack running now adds some sort of... saturation that adds infinitely to the experience. And that&#039;s without ambient sounds or sound effects!<br><br>You remember yesterday when I said that as of today I&#039;d be back to normal speed? That didn&#039;t end up happening... Instead I spent the day at a roadside rest stop while waiting for a mechanic to show up and fix the bus, and when that didn&#039;t work out for another bus to show up, etc. But now I&#039;m arrived! Some work got done on the bus though, some art, some thinking, some mapping out how damage is going to work as a system (right now it&#039;s mostly a million special cases) and some coding as well, for as long as I had batteries. Normal speed as of tomorrow, promise!

@ crispy: this aspect is something were really cognizant of, and plan on keeping the two visual realms as discreet territory so as to avoid visual conflict. in fact, thats one of the reasons why we stopped working on the &quot;architectural letters&quot; concept, was that it required a lot of already very visually-distinct elements to be represented in a different style. the characters are tiny, 24 pixels or whatever, so there is a lot more leeway. and if you are going to take that leap and do detail on *anything*, its got to be slugcat!<br><br>its a tale as old as time though, and pretty much every videogame has to deal with this visual incongruity in one way or another and each path has its own potential pitfalls haha<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160726070611im_/https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/dd/Mega_Man_1_box_artwork.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160726070611im_/http://i.imgur.com/0UT32jRl.jpg" alt="" border="0">

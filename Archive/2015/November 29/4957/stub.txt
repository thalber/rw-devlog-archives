it&#039;ll still be a *little* while. we need to polish everything up, get all the progression mechanics tied in, balance the damage system, UI and menus, finish the music and audio, do some heavy QA etc. BUT all that is pretty straight ahead compared to what we have been doing. so yeah sort of! you&#039;ll very likely be seeing some announcements about release timeframe soon&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308163750im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/toast.gif" alt="Beer!" border="0">

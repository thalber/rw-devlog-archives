But how to communicate it? It seems a little harsh that first you survive eating too little, but the next time BAM total binary death haha!</div><br>I think that&#039;s where your establishing pictures might take over. Say you return from a hunt under-fed, when you settle down to go to sleep you either get a picture/animation showing the slugcat returning happily and healthily, or you get one showing the slugcat exhausted and hungry. This lets players know that something is up. Maybe the bat symbols fill up to show how many you ended up with, like a score screen?<br><br>Then before you start the next round, you either see the slugcat getting up looking healthy and ready to go, or the slugcat is looking pretty rough and possibly slightly emaciated (ribs showing or something, but nothing that would have to show up on the character avatar itself). Maybe the bat symbols are outlined in red this time, to let you know itÂ’s serious?<br><br>If you return under-fed this time, the end-picture would of course be the slugcat returning looking incredibly exhausted and starved, and then some sort of death-screen to demonstrate that the slugcat had starved during hibernation.<br><br>If there&#039;s still room for confusion about how the slugcat could be all emaciated after just going to sleep, perhaps the timeframe could be illustrated by an animation/illustration montage showing the rains coming and a week or (or however long a rain cycle is) so passing? That might be a nice break between hunting cycles, providing a little downbeat to punctuate gameplay.<br><br>I dunno, that might be way more illustration than you&#039;d want to actually have (I think it has the potential to be really beautiful), but it&#039;s an example of one way you might go about it.<br></div><br>This sounds about right! <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150401072917im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/hand-thumbsup-r.gif" alt="Hand Thumbs Up Right" border="0"> <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150401072917im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/hand-thumbsup-r.gif" alt="Hand Thumbs Up Right" border="0"> <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150401072917im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/hand-thumbsup-r.gif" alt="Hand Thumbs Up Right" border="0"> <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150401072917im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/hand-thumbsup-r.gif" alt="Hand Thumbs Up Right" border="0"> <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150401072917im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/hand-thumbsup-r.gif" alt="Hand Thumbs Up Right" border="0"><br><br>We have been discussing maybe taking in an illustrator, and I think that if we end up going down this route it might actually be necessary, because my own visual art skills are super rusty by now haha! Also after a year of programming and almost no drawing, my procedural animation skills have developed simultaneously as my drawing has rusted away, so I don&#039;t really know if I could make illustrations that could live up to the level of the in-game graphics. And then comes the issue of time o_0 The problem is of course that I&#039;m super particular with the style... We&#039;ll see how it goes! Lots of programming to do before this is on the table!<br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150401072917/http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.msg1123996#msg1123996">Quote from: tortoiseandcrow on March 27, 2015, 03:17:13 PM</a></div><div class="quote">Also, congrats!

Ill admit im a little apprehensive about it tbh. The region its &quot;intended&quot; for (in my mind) is the Garbage Wastes, in which having angular junk sticking out in the background is just a good look, and if that winds up having a more unique look to it as a result then so much the better. so anyway i&#039;ll have a bit of a prop editor sandbox to play in and develop technique with it before applying it elsewhere. if we can get some cool stuff out of it there, i&#039;ll go back and add them in to the regions already done in a 2nd/3rd pass.<br></div><br>I&#039;m actually happy to hear that you&#039;re a bit apprehensive, because I feel that cautiously is the right way to go into this. We do have an art style that&#039;s well defined and appreciated by a lot of people, and this is definitely going to change things up, so let&#039;s be careful about it. That said, I think just little touches (such as having 4 columns in the background, of which one is broken and resting against its neighbor) can really spice things up. Everything being aligned to the grid gives the world a sort of consistency and rigor that&#039;s probably needed in order to make the environments feel like something you can understand and navigate. Stuff that&#039;s not on the grid will definitely need to be the exception rather than the rule, or it will get too visually noisy. Let&#039;s experiment with it and see where it goes!

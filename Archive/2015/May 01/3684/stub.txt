ha! i think that specific comparison was more geared toward me, who has a strong opinion of the differences of course. (left is vastly preferred for my purposes)<br><br>Since Joar is working on Shadow Urban tile stuff, and ive wrapped up what I can do with Garbage Wastes for the time being, im back at hacking away at the audio. (despite my upstairs neighbor noisily renovating his apartment!) I had promised a rough audio demo, so here is what we&#039;ve got going on so far:<br><br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505022238/https://youtu.be/inK0kQvzsg8" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/inK0kQvzsg8</a><br><br>The volume is low here for audio nerd purposes (need that headroom!) You may notice its a much more naturalistic sounding direction from the more &quot;gamey&quot; audio of the lingo. There are a few &quot;characteristic rain world&quot; sounds, like the super jump, bat screeches and terrain impact &quot;thud&quot;, that i kept from the previous version because with a little polish and contextual application they totally still work. and i like them!<br><br>From a technical standpoint its nothing terribly exciting, though we are probably doing 20x more sample instances and procedural implementation than a platformer usually has. basically every audio trigger (of the approximately 1 million that Joar set so far) has around 5-20 samples attached to it, and each of those samples is randomized by pitch and volume within a certain narrow range. This is mostly just because i get way too involved and micromanagy with this sort of stuff, but the world sounds much more alive and deep when you dont hear so many repeated sounds. i get completely taken out of immersion when i hear mechanically repeated sounds in game audio, so im stoked to get the opportunity to take the time and do it right.<br><br>anyway, another few hundred triggers, some polish and the same level of detail applied to the ambient audio, i think we&#039;ll have a pretty nice aural experience for you guys <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505022238im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0"> <br><br>here is an older lingo demo clip for comparison, and to slap me upside the head with how much progression has been made (warning the audio is much louder here):<br><br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505022238/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahgvic-l-D0" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahgvic-l-D0</a><br>

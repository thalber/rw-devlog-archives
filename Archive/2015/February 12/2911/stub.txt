I love how you guys are like &quot;this was the whole map for the old game&quot; and now are like &quot;well, the new game already covers that map... it&#039;s gonna be like 5 times bigger than that old one. We hare way over our heads.&quot; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309173009im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/tongue.gif" alt="Tongue" border="0"> I kid.<br><br></div><br>well, i mean, TRUEE... but also that was concept stuff put together before we had done any level work done. Actually putting together a region and getting a feel for the scale we wanted to convey was much more important than my little boxy map sketch <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309173009im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0"> Once we had the SU map put together it was pretty apparent that this was the way things were going to go.<br><br>so Joar just mentioned the widescreen addition casually in the last update, but WOW was that a huuuuuuuuuge addition. The entire game has been built around 16:9 format from the start, the geometry of every room and screen was structured around it, but I think we were so used to our little 4:3 alpha window that we didnt even realize what we were missing. Fortunately our earlier selves planned this out well! <br><br>Long story short: the game plays SO MUCH BETTER in 16:9, how its supposed to be. You see paths and lizards and creatures that were previously off-screen, sometimes before they see you, giving you time to plan actual sneaks or escapes like you are supposed to! Plus you can finally really watch the ecosystem interactions that Joar has been working forever on, things like spotting a vulture and waiting for it to to swoop down on a group of pink lizards before you make your move through a tricky room, etc.<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309173009im_/https://i.imgur.com/WS8l119l.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Plus the scale just POPS. I&#039;ve been building these rooms in 16:9 but other than in a little schematic preview window in the editor, havent been able to see the full picture until now. tears of joy&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309173009im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/tearsofjoy.gif" alt="Tears of Joy" border="0"><br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309173009im_/https://i.imgur.com/SJlB0WPl.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>This does, however, mean that I now have tons of touching up to do on the levels. Surprisingly (to me!) most look prettttty good, but there are definitely a few that have un-tiled portions or some other unfinished aspect out there in the wings where I couldn&#039;t see before. Also, it highlights a few other ares of roughness like the camera switching which could use some polish.<br><br>But that said, HUGE step forward.<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309173009im_/https://i.imgur.com/ojaBL2Rl.png" alt="" border="0">

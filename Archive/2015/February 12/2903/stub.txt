It will take a while to get through doing all the levels for sure, but that at least is a clear grind path for me and the cost:benefit is fairly high. but we have yet to work out some big technical stuff, things like large multi-screens, darkness and split-screen co-op, plus there is a list of backer-suggested creatures a mile long each of which will take a decent amount of time as Joar (quite understandably) only wants well-thought-out, well-realized creatures in this game we&#039;ve been agonizing over for years.<br><br>that said, from there everything else has been going pretty much to plan, almost shockingly so. as its just two people sometimes linear progress can seem a bit slow, but we are definitely chugging along!&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309173009im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/gentleman.gif" alt="Gentleman" border="0">

Haha yeah, as James says, we are about at the scope we originally planned for the entire game right now, and we don&#039;t have half the areas yet. More like, a fourth. So ... That&#039;s that. This thing is gonna be vast o___0<br><br><b>Update 396</b><br><br>I&#039;ve been running the MEGA WORLD today, and doing some profiling etc. My basic take away is that at this size, it would be theoretically possible to have the entire world run simultaneously, but it&#039;s really an edge case - and with more content coming up, we&#039;re going to have to divide it somehow. Either that or some sort of lazy loading of rooms. I&#039;m not all that keen on either, because they do mean more systems that can entangle themselves in other systems, bug out, etc etc. The cleanest possible solution for this would be best. Abstract space/realized space division is already a mess, and adding one more layer of abstraction like that seems bad. <br><br>What slows stuff down is basically two things: creatures finding paths offscreen, which is kind of expected and not very problematic - I&#039;ve not optimized that stuff at all, and there&#039;s potentially a lot that can be done - and loading of rooms files from the folder. This latter one puzzles me. It should take exactly as long to load a file whether there&#039;s a big world or a small world hanging out in RAM, to my knowledge. <br><br>The other weird thing is this - if I have a small world, and 5 rooms realized in it, everything runs as supposed to. But a huge world, with <i>still only 5 rooms</i>, it will spend twice as long updating <i>those rooms</i>. In the method&#039;s &quot;self&quot; - not delegating anywhere. I have no idea what&#039;s going on here. Could it be that having all of the abstract rooms in RAM somehow... idk, makes the processor slower? The rooms already have waaaay more data stored in their AI maps than the abstract rooms put together can ever compare to, so it really is an enigma.<br><br>Other than that, fixing, brushing up, sorting out. Today I spent some time messing with bats getting stuck at room borders, which became a lot of trouble in the new Chimney Canopy area which has a lot of open room borders. Also tried to make bats get stuck less in terrain and look overall a little more competent. Don&#039;t know quite how successful I was, but some stuff got better, definitely.<br><br>And, widescreen:<br><br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309173009/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/02/12/A1cXR.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309173009im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/02/12/A1cXR.png" alt="" width="270" height="150" border="0"></a><br><br>Playing in widescreen is pretty damn sweet actually! It feels like my eyes were opened for the very first time! I&#039;ll probably never be able to go back without suffering horrible claustrophobia. <br><br>Still some work to do on the widescreen stuff - water isn&#039;t completely comfortable with it yet, and the shaders need a little bit of adaption.

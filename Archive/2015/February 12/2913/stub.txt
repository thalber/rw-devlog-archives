it is a little tricky to visualize I imagine, and is complicated further by the multi-screen rooms. i dont have time to do a full write up on it today, but here is a quick and dirty screenshot comparison:<br><br>*ignore what looks like a difference in height between screenchots, thats just the limits of TIGS image preview width. widescreen will be the same height obv, just W I D E R*<br><br>4:3<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309173009im_/https://i.imgur.com/vr2QNWDl.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br><br>16:9<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309173009im_/https://i.imgur.com/WS8l119l.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br><br><br>now for single-screen rooms, its not that big of a difference other than the added scale and visual canvas size that the widescreen camera shows. the playable area remains the same in both 4:3 and 16:9 regardless, etc etc. but it becomes a big deal for multi-screen rooms which are more the focus of the game as it progresses. <br><br>previously (as you know from the alpha), you would switch the cameras in multi-screen rooms by going off-screen just to the left or the right (or up/down, but not relevant to this example), the camera just follows you at the edge of screen border and it works okaaaay. but when hungry lizards or other creatures might be waiting just off-screen to snatch you up, you&#039;ll sometimes just get eaten unfairly. with the widescreen 16:9 you can see well beyond the camera switch point to avoid nasty surprises and have room / time to plan your moves accordingly. also it allows for better platforming, as room movement puzzles can take up more physical space, you can jump from one camera to another and see where you are going/landing, etc. all in all just *everything is better in widescreen*<br><br>whats interesting though is that because of some of the consoles we are targeting (PS Vita for instance with that tiny screen), we have to develop everything for 4:3 and 16:9 simultaneously. So its probably good that we spent as much time with 4:3 as we did. Now is the time for 16:9 to shine though!<br><br>ok, enough of me putting off these room touch-ups. back to the level editor pit!

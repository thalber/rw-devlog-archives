these gates are going to be rad. the shelters added so much to the mood, so its exciting to imagine experiencing these for the first time as a player, not knowing whats going on. will be so cool and moody! and im quite looking forward to sound designing the hell out of them :]<br><br>past few days ive been working on the first dark region, and this talk about spoilers has made me realize that pretty much all of the dark stuff on my end will be fairly spoiler-proof already. screenshots wont show much other than a white blob, so unless we want to do a video literally running through a room or something, it&#039;ll just have to be left to the experience. which is good! but also might make for some dry spots in my contributions to the devlog tho

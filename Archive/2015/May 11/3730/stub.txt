Hi! Hope everyone had a nice weekend!<br><br>So, from what I&#039;m picking up here most people would like to keep the updates pretty much as they are. I think that means that we are not doing some total devlog blackout. Maybe we can walk some kind of golden... not middle road, but two-thirds-road? Like, I devlog pretty much everything I do, but if there is something small I think would be particularly fun to find out for yourself (and which is small enough to not be a big project that strangely keeps me quiet for several days), I omit it. Also, we want to include a lot of what we call &quot;set piece rooms&quot;, which will be a special room with custom art and maybe a few lines of code that creates some interesting visual or interaction in that room. The reason for having these is that we have this huge world, and if you go exploring you should obviously be rewarded occasionally by finding something interesting. To me it seems like these could be a pretty perfect fit for something to keep quiet about - they&#039;re there specifically for the joy of exploration, and they are not mega projects that will take forever.<br><br>&nbsp;<div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308155435/https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?PHPSESSID=us1vf7h2eoqhphbqs7fcg3qmc7&amp;topic=25183.msg1137461#msg1137461">Quote from: Teod on May 08, 2015, 02:17:32 PM</a></div><div class="quote"><br><br>* There should be at least one region we know nothing about (themes, mechanics, creatures, location in the world, etc).<br>* In every known region there should be at least one creature we know nothing about (looks, mechanics, behavior, etc).<br>* Every known creature should have at least one mechanic or behavior we know nothing about.

For regions, it&#039;s James making those, and though he does use the devlog he doesn&#039;t as much as I am, so it would maybe not be too big a difference for him to just do a region sneakily without letting anyone know. Number three is sort of already happening a little bit, as I mess about with the creatures I sometimes add little features and interactions that never make it to the devlog. It&#039;s not that systematic (one per creature) but there are a few things going on with most creatures that are not on the devlog, small and very small. I could perhaps be a little bit more deliberate about this! For number two, a creature is generally at least a week-long project to implement, and the region to creature ratio is currently around 1:1... Meaning that this would basically be me making an entire new RW in secret, pushing the release twice as far and create devlog blackouts for half of that time haha! But good suggestions, I&#039;ll keep this in mind&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308155435im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/hand-thumbsup-r.gif" alt="Hand Thumbs Up Right" border="0"><br><br><b>Update 425</b><br>Puuuuuuuh it&#039;s been a very region gate weekend indeed. Here they are:<br><br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308155435/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/05/11/gtc4f.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308155435im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/05/11/gtc4f.png" alt="" width="400" height="227" border="0"></a><br>(click to expand)<br><br>The central gate mechanism will look pretty much the same for all gates, but out to the edges there will be some room for James to add a little bit of individual flavor, and maybe hint at the regions the gate is bordering to. This one is Vanilla though, why it&#039;s just plain metal on the sides, real gates bordering to regions might look a little more interesting in those areas.<br><br>And a few gifs showing the walking through them. First of all, the gate closing behind you:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308155435im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/05/11/PhHwj.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mandatory </span>sauna:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308155435im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/05/11/vaq4r.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>And passing through to the other side. Ignore the cheesy palette swap at the end of this, I still haven&#039;t entirely figured out how the palette swap between regions should work, so I just slapped on a ... palette swap. Gotta come up with something better for that.<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308155435im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/05/11/gacAS.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Also, James and I have been talking about how these are going to work gameplay-wise a little bit. You might notice the water cistern up top - it&#039;s more visible when it&#039;s empty after you have passed through the gate:<br><br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308155435/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/05/11/WLPzK.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308155435im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/05/11/WLPzK.png" alt="" width="400" height="227" border="0"></a><br>(click to expand)<br><br>The gates are powered by the water in that cistern, is the idea. It&#039;s not visible in the gif because I had to crop it, but there is always water running as the doors are working to make this seem plausible. The gameplay implication of this is that you can only pass through a region gate once per rain cycle. You can technically go back to the same region twice, but you&#039;ll have to circle around and find some other way in - each specific gate only opens once. When the rain returns the water replenishes. The reason why we think this could be an interesting game mechanic is because it somewhat increases your stakes. When finding a new region you will naturally experience the excitement of exploration from entering a new area, and the idea is that this will be enhanced by making the experience a little bit nervous as well. Because with the gate shutting behind you, you don&#039;t have the option to just dip a toe in the new region and opt out if it wasn&#039;t to your liking. Instead you will have to find food and shelter (or at least a way back) in the new alien region. Most of the regions actually have a shelter and an easily accessible swarm room close by the gate, but maybe not all... So walking through one of these gates will really be equal to throwing yourself into the unknown. Hopefully this nervous feeling will be enhanced by the 40 seconds of gate mechanisms clicking and clacking and you being steamed like a dumpling, haha!<br><br>I&#039;m really happy region gates are coming together, but there are still a couple of technicalities to be taken care of. One thing I have no idea how to solve is what to do with a creature that followed you into the gate room but ended up on the outside of the gate. Then we have a realized creature with an abstract representation that should actually be hanging out in another region from the room which the realized creature is in o__0 Going to be real interesting how I solve that one!

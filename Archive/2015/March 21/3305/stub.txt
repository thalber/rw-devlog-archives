We&#039;re really stoked about this region, because it&#039;s one that we&#039;ve had a lot of ideas for for a long time. I also think it&#039;s pretty much the only region so far that we&#039;ve had some pretty clear visual concepts for going into it, so let&#039;s see how that plays out. If it shows to be a super benefit we might want to do more concept art etc in the future before throwing ourselves into a new region. That said James has been improvising really solid visual identities for all the other regions (maybe with the exception of the first one, which was originally a bit here and there as James was learning as he made it, but which has been reeled in to a much more solid aesthetic identity in the last overhaul). So let&#039;s see what happens! I think that if James has been able to make as good looking regions as we&#039;ve seen so far <i>without </i>much coordinated planning, this new region has potential to look really amazing just because of the fact that we had this visual idea, making sure that I was on the same wave length while making the tiles as James will be when composing the geometries. <br><br>And now I think there&#039;s no way to put off the inevitable any more... All of the candidates for next upcoming regions need rooms larger than 3 screens, so the overhaul has to happen. So, good bye for a couple of days! I&#039;ll write some small little progress reports I think, but probably not proper updates as there won&#039;t be all that much to talk about.

&#12619;&#12619;&#12619;&#12619;&#12619; granted! But earlier you&#039;ve had to work with whatever random tiles I happened to throw together for that region (me being the one with no visual concept) whereas here we have a more <i>coordinated</i> idea of how things should look! Basically what I&#039;m getting at is that &quot;I also know what this area will look like!&quot; ... which is obviously not true, as you always ends up using the tiles in unexpected ways...<br><br>One thing that is nice for sure though is to go into a region with the region specific tiles already in place! Usually you&#039;ll have gotten like 40% through before I manage to deliver the first batch&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308153346im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/shocked.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0"> Man, tiles take sooo long...

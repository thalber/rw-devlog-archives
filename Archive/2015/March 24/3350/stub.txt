I remember you had a slugcat camera tracker way back. Do you have plans on implementing this so that moving through screens will be smooth?<br></div><br>Yup, sorry! If you look at for example the water, you see that the levels have a bit of 2.5D perspective rendered into them, and this stuff needs to be rendered from a specific camera position. That&#039;s why we can&#039;t just render the room from a bunch of camera positions and then graft the pieces together into a continuously scrolling unit. There was a moment when we played around with the idea of having each of the 30 layers be its own separate sprite in order to scroll, but that would put each room at about 10-15 MB (per screen!) and slow down the rendering quite a bit, possibly to the point where that would be the only cool graphical effect we could do. Basically everything we have now that&#039;s good looking shader-wise (water, shadows, darkness, etc etc) relies on the level being a single texture. So it&#039;s been a bit of a trade-off, and definitely a decision we have seriously considered before making, but now it&#039;s made and it&#039;s gonna be fixed screens, with jarring jumps between them. If you play in wide screen there&#039;s a bit of an overlap, which makes it somewhat better because at least you know a few tiles of the terrain you&#039;re headed into. Buuuut yeah, we know this is maybe not strictly optimal, yet we consider it worth it after carefully weighing the options.<br><br>Shelter 2 review seemed super relevant!<br><br>As for the stomach stuff, I realize when reading the stuff you guys are discussing that I&#039;ve never really considered the actual bat eating a full-fledged, interesting mechanic in its own right. Subconsciously the bat hunting has always been just a &quot;reason to play&quot;, while the actual interesting gameplay is the predator encounters. Under this logic it made sense to just say &quot;catch this many bats or you&#039;ll starve&quot; - that&#039;s the minimum needed to actually propel the player out into the world. This might be a problem! Catching bats is what you do, after all ~ so it should probably be interesting enough in itself. However, this might be a pretty common video game trope? In Mario you win by reaching the flag at the end of the stage - the flag reaching itself is actually pretty anticlimactic, you just... reach the flag. What&#039;s interesting is the problems facing you in order to get there. To a degree I think this is desirable and/or unavoidable, in a video game it will always be the obstacles that are interesting rather than the goals themselves. However, because of the nature of our game, the obstacles can&#039;t really be guaranteed - predators roam as they please, and a certain percent of cycles you&#039;ll be able to go get the bats without actually encountering any, or only encounter them in easily avoidable situations. For these scenarios, we probably need to make the bat hunting interesting in itself.<br><br>I&#039;m still not sold on making the slugcat stomach an entire intricate sub-system, though. I think it&#039;s bat hunting that needs to be made more interesting, not bat ... eh ... digestion. When it comes to starvation states that stuff is certainly interesting, but there&#039;d really be no way to do it without punishing a player who&#039;s performing poorly. Nature generally punishes the weak (if you&#039;re starving you become slow and dumb, if you&#039;re born poor you have fewer opportunities, etc etc) but a video game should do the opposite (the further back you are in mario kart, the better power ups you get). This combines with the design guideline that the slugcat should generally not be affected by status effects too much - the slugcat is this little blank-eyed, completely white silhouette, it&#039;s a blank slate to project yourself onto, and only through controlling it you can make it succeed or fail. It shouldn&#039;t be bogged down or beefed up by lasting &quot;stats&quot;, it&#039;s defined only in the moment, by the situation it&#039;s currently in and by the player controlling it. The slugcat <i>does </i>things rather than <i>is </i>things. Starved and fat are adjectives rather than verbs, and for that reason I&#039;m not sure they fit the slugcat character.<br><br>But this is sort of a separate branch of the UI discussion. As for the strictly UI related discussion, I would definitely love to do it without throwing symbols on the screen. The problem is that most solutions seem to require stylistical diversions. A stomach rumbling animation or burping bubbles is a little too goofy for the somewhat grim and creepy atmosphere in the game. Where the slugcat looks and what idle animations it has is probably too subtle, and it veers into the adjective territory. I doubt naturalistic sound cues would work as there&#039;ll be a quite a bit of weird stomach-growly ambient sounds going on, and artificial sound cues such as an upwards DIIING if you have enough and a downwards BEEENG if you don&#039;t is essentially just as HUD as an on-screen HUD, just coming through your speakers instead of on the screen. Having the character change color would work, but then it&#039;d have to be really clear to effectively communicate what&#039;s going on, and might mess with the art style. And what about coop and multiplayer? For proper multiplayer, aka Sandbox, we&#039;ll probably have to give in an add actual UI either way because there&#039;ll be game rules and stuff going on, and support for 4 players. That&#039;s okay though, as Sandbox isn&#039;t really canon - it&#039;s just for fun. But coop is a strange mid-case.<br><br>My favorite option so far is to just evade the problem entirely by having the required amount of bats always be the same, but I don&#039;t know if that is James&#039; from a level design viewpoint. Also it still doesn&#039;t solve the problem of conveying how many of the required bats you&#039;ve caught so far.<br><br>Not trying to shoot your ideas down btw, I&#039;m really interested in this discussion and there has been a lot of great stuff coming up - just haven&#039;t seen The One idea just yet.

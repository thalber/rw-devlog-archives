Sorry for not being very active in this discussion, I&#039;m deep in level editor overhaul. But just wanted to let you know I&#039;m following it, and there&#039;s a lot of interesting stuff popping up&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150627030240im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/hand-thumbsup-r.gif" alt="Hand Thumbs Up Right" border="0"><br><br>In overhaul news, I have just played the first ever 20-screen room in RW history! It takes something like 3-4 minutes of just running to get from one end to the other. Most of the level editor logistics become pretty awkward at this level size, but it technically works. I seriously doubt we&#039;d want/need to go beyond 10 screens anywhere in the game, but it&#039;s cool to know that 20 is a theoretical possibility.<br><br>Note though that the mile stone here was that a 20 screen room was actually spit out by the editor and accepted by the game, not that everything is done and flawlessly working haha! Basically all the effects (rust, slime, plants) need to be adapted to the new rendering pipeline, and quite a lot of other stuff has to be sorted out as well. But hope is good and there&#039;s wind in the sails! Onward!

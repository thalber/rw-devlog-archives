Ohhhhh I&#039;m really into Gimmy&#039;s bat idea. Joar had plans for something similar using move timing and an &quot;adrenalin&quot; system to unlock more advanced move sets (which I really liked the idea of), but the bats as a perpetually available version of the same makes perfect sense, solves a bunch of problems and is already built in. See this is why you&#039;re our lead designer G.&nbsp;

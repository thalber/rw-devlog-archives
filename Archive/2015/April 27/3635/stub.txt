@RainWorldIsAwesome, yes, most certainly!<br><br>@NicoM, yep a creature grabbing another creature is just a temporary connection between chunks!<br><br>@NicoM and compostface, go right ahead, the world is big enough for both of us <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309162437im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0"> Also, I actually don&#039;t think our games are that similar, you guys certainly have your own style. Rain World basically started out as an attempt to rip off Lyle in Cube Sector, but took its own turns. If you have some sort of artistic urge you can&#039;t really truly rip something off, you&#039;ll always make it your own and that makes ripping off a really good starting point! Another big inspiration for me is Tsutomu Nihei&#039;s stuff, such as BLAME and Biomega, you should definitely check that out if you haven&#039;t - I think it might actually be even more relevant to you guys&#039; project than it has ended up being to this one. This is the best part of the internet, inspiration and ideas flowing all over the place!<br>

Been playing this new region a bit, and I&#039;ve been having a lot of fun! By this point James is way past black belt in level design, and the rooms have super fun platforming challenges that work really really well with the creatures. The rooms having multiple paths through them has been standard for some time, but for this region he&#039;s taken it to the next level by building the rooms to be dual purpose, each is essentially a level for rain world and a level for whatever game it becomes when you pick up a grappling hook - with the ability to switch between the two at any point. And most of them have multiple routes even within those&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308163009im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/shocked.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0"><br><br>To sort of give you an idea there&#039;s this room that has daddy long legs crawling about, a bunch of tube worms, and a pretty big pack of yellow lizards. Daddies like large open spaces, the yellow lizards like maze like structures where they can do a lot of flanking and surrounding their prey. Standard slugcat likes platforms and poles, slugcat with grappling hook likes smaller floating pieces of terrain to grapple and swing from. The room is 10 screens large, with all of these environments flowing in and out of each other, here and there with overlaps that force the creatures to encounters. Throughout the entire thing are multiple grappling hook routes and routes for when you&#039;re without the hook, some of them sharing certain passages and then diverging again. All of them however come together at a bottleneck in the middle of the room, forcing you to move through all the different little sub-environments and be subjected to their critters. This means that you&#039;re sort of forced to go through most of the room, but you can still shape your experience depending on your resources and preferences. Amazing level design!

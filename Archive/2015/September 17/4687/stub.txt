a good part of the nerfing will just be making it unable to go through shortcuts, limiting the trouble it can get into a bit. also doing this region in a more linear fashion really brought into focus one of the key aspects of the game, the inherently chaotic nature of the open world ecosystem model. creatures can go anywhere and do anything they want to. it can be both the main strength of the game if handled well, and completely destroy all your well-laid plans if not. <br><br>Underhang region sort of skirts that line a bit. its playable, but the linearity combined with the HUGE reach of the daddy makes it insanely hard at times. basically, if a daddy decides to camp in the middle of a key room, there is just nothing you can do. so i think rather than nerf the daddy TOO much, adding a couple of strategic alternate route paths, allowing you (or the daddy) to go around, will definitely help make this more playable without removing the &quot;teeth&quot; so to speak. <br><br>I was hesitant to do this earlier, as the region is already insanely huge (takes me 4 rain cycles and 24 minutes to speed run from one side to the other with no creatures), but ive identified a few key spots where i could add a single 2-screen room to each and it would both keep the structure of the region and should solve the daddy bottlenecks.<br><br>off to it then!

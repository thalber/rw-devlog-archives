The updated version of the Daddy acts like a scary creature rather than a giant impassible scrub brush of death. Joar fixed their movement, added a very cool &quot;thunder-blindness&quot; disruption, and some tweaking to the ecosystem interactions helped out quite a bit. With these chaotic systems its such an odd balance. One seemingly minor tweak has huge implications for play. In this case, Joar made the the Tube Worms quieter, which completely affected how the sound-hunting Daddies behaved in large rooms. <br><br>Sort of along those lines, one of my favorite emergent encounters yet happened in this region. Of course I had planned plenty of &quot;set-piece&quot; style encounters in this region, hives of yellows, death-defying platform swinging around daddies, etc., and all that went off really well, but the one ive been having the most fun is of course the one that happened completely by accident: <br><br>In the first few Underhang rooms are a sub-region called &quot;the legs&quot;, where you climb the interior of a large support column. The platforming is pretty tricky, its where you first encounter the tube worm grappling mechanic, so i kept is fairly free of predators, but since its a decent stretch of the map, just for fun a threw in 2 white lizards to spice it up a little. The geometry here is ideal for them, but i didnt realize how good it was going to be. It basically turns into a 10 screen climbing duel with the whites, fighting to climb from platform to platform and swinging around their tongues, knocking them off platforms with rocks, only to have them scramble back up after you. Then all the noise attracts a daddy of course, and it turns into complete mayhem just as the rains start to fall...<br><br>Now thats in there permanently and im taking full credit for it <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308163009im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/cheesy.gif" alt="Cheesy" border="0"><br><br>Anyway, Underhang is a wrap for now, so on to region 11!

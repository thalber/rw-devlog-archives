It&#039;s a tough balance for me, on the one hand I have my vision, on the other I of course take in what you say. It might be the case that it looks a little out of place compared to the already existing creatures, but according to <i>me </i>that&#039;s because the other creatures aren&#039;t enough like this, not the other way around. My idea for this world has always been a broad gradient of strange biotechnological stuff and less strange stuff, with something like intestines in a box on one end and an apparently all-natural leech on the other. This is the first one where I&#039;ve really gotten some clear, unambiguous machine parts in (the vulture feathers are metal in my head, but I don&#039;t know about you), and I&#039;m pretty stoked about it. However I can see that some of you might not be, if you started following this project thinking it was something else. <br><br>It was the same with the blinking lizard heads, if you remember? I had my idea, I knew what I wanted it to look like, and no-one agreed. To get pretentious for a bit, I think the problem is inherent to sharing an art process. Why do we make art - because we have some idea we want to get across where we need pictures and music and stuff, because words just doesn&#039;t work to explain this particular thing in its entirety. If James and I could write everything we wanted to express in this project, we would have done so, it could not possibly have been more time consuming&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308161326im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/cheesy.gif" alt="Cheesy" border="0"><br><br>So, because of this, it&#039;s sort of by definition impossible for me to <i>fully </i>explain what I want this thing to be, because that explanation is nothing more or less than the final product. We&#039;re working our way there!<br><br>That said, it&#039;s definitely not impossible or unnecessary to talk about a creative process. And I really do value you guys&#039; input, it has contributed to huge improvements. Remember a couple of weeks ago when you just wouldn&#039;t leave me alone about those water jets? Water jets now look 800% better because of it!<br><br>Also when talking about lore and world building stuff your input has been really valuable. But in this domain, James and I have to have the last word because, well, it&#039;s our project ~ The cool thing about being indie is that you&#039;re not trying to appeal to some focus group or something, after all! So, I guess we&#039;ll have to ask you to just trust us a bit here - we have a cool idea, when things start coming together you&#039;ll get a better picture of it! Maybe you&#039;ll be disappointed because it doesn&#039;t line up with the idea you had imagined for the project&#039;s future, but we can&#039;t possibly line up with everyone&#039;s ideas, so just give us the benefit of the doubt that it might still be a pretty cool idea regardless <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308161326im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0"> <br><br>TLDR; I hear you, but wait and see for a bit and I hope it will make sense. If it doesn&#039;t it&#039;s definitely not impossible to change cosmetic stuff later!<br><br><b>Update 452</b><br><br>Jaw slamming shut:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308161326im_/https://giant.gfycat.com/SlimFinishedCow.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>I&#039;ve also made it able to eat creatures. Contrary to other RW creatures that usually need to bring their prey back with them to their dens, this one just swallows them whole there and then. Even several at a time!<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308161326im_/https://giant.gfycat.com/DisfiguredGreenKillifish.gif" alt="" border="0">

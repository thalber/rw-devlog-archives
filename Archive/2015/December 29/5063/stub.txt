<b>Update 500</b><br><br>So we&#039;re doing update 500 finally <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308164440im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0"> James is doing a video that shows a playthrough of the new Heavy Industrial region - it will probably be up in a few hours. It won&#039;t show you anything like new creatures or so, but for those of you who have played the alpha in particular it might be interesting to see how the game <i>plays </i>in its current form, contrary to cut up trailer footage. Also the map will be demoed. <br><br>In the mean time, I thought maybe some scavengers would be exciting!<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308164440im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/12/29/8mtz.gif" alt="" border="0">&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308164440im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/12/29/Ld0rn.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308164440im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/12/29/dLHPr.gif" alt="" border="0">&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308164440im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/12/29/fsQ9.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308164440im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/12/29/ZLwxq.gif" alt="" border="0">&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308164440im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/12/29/YwSDi.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308164440im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/12/29/XVwve.gif" alt="" border="0">&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308164440im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/12/29/BFaLU.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308164440im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/12/29/shyg.gif" alt="" border="0">&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308164440im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/12/29/ZTzJ0.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308164440im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/12/29/CkF4x.gif" alt="" border="0">&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308164440im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/12/29/tKz5i.gif" alt="" border="0"><br>

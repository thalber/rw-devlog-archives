You would eventually learn the minimum amount of time, and every second you push it after that is risk/reward.<br></div><br>yep, this is my thinking exactly. i mean, obviously you cant have anything approaching full randomization, that would be unfair and awful to play. the regions are setup in a way that you can find food and navigate between shelters within a certain time-frame, and so the randomization im thinking of would be a fuzzy border around that to keep you on your toes. if we could do it on a bell curve, where every once in a while you get some more extreme effects, that could be cool though. Blend that with the dynamic light rain weather patterns and you&#039;ve got some potential rain PTSD brewin! <br><br>Also Joar is talking about some some subtle experience-enhancing stuff that could potentially be hidden within that variability too, so i hope it winds up working out that way!

@Christian, thank you very much! The encouragement means a lot!<br><br>@Teod, that water seems to be tile-based rather than particle based, and something along those lines is not out of the question. Just want to mess around with the visuals and make sure it&#039;s actually needed first - it would be a pretty huge project regardless. As for the light rain, there&#039;s not really a big risk of mixing it up. The actual death rain announces itself with screen shake and rumbling before it arrives (in the lingo build only that, no rain buildup) so it&#039;s probably the shaking you&#039;re going to rely on for knowing when the death rain will arrive rather than the slight rain effects.<br><br>@tortoiseandcrow, on the rain timer, that&#039;s not entirely settled yet, but will be very easy to tune. James is in favor of randomized rain cycle length, but I&#039;m a little more hesitant. Pros are that it keeps you on the edge of your chair, and that it goes hand in hand with the procedural nature that much of the game relies on. Pros for having it be a set time (or randomized within a very narrow limit) is that then you will gradually start to learn how long a cycle is, which feels like you would be internalizing a bit of slugcat instinct, which is cool. We&#039;ll just try both, I think!<br><br>@Slader16, the annoying dev answer is that everything does, to different degrees. The less annoying dev answer is that I don&#039;t quite know yet - so far it seems to be running fine with creatures in a connected world, but I have more water effects etc that I want to experiment with, so I&#039;m not quite there yet. <br><br>Also the performance is different between my dev environment in Unity and the compiled and finished executable, which sometimes causes some confusion. My current idea is that I will use the slower performance in the Unity editor as a sort of development &quot;handicap&quot;, whatever I do should be playable there in order to make sure that the executable will also be playable on slightly slower machines than mine. However, sometimes the Unity editor has weird slowdowns that doesn&#039;t seem to have to do with anything - the game gets framy in just a single empty room with the player in it. It might have to do with how long the computer has gone without a restart or something like that. To make it even weirder, the fps display in Unity doesn&#039;t seem to know of these weird slowdowns. Currently I have a little bit of &quot;ghost slowdown&quot; like that, so it&#039;s hard to know about the rain performance until I grit my teeth and go through the horrible effort of actually restarting my computer&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309173127im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/cheesy.gif" alt="Cheesy" border="0">

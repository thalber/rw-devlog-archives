good feedback and questions!<br><br><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: tortiseandcrow</div><div class="quote">&nbsp; I&#039;m very interested in the cards on the table insofar as anything dynamic or emergent goes, but would prefer to be kept in the dark where one-off events or encounters are concerned (though it would be really interesting to have some insight into at least one of those as well, just to see the thought-process behind it). I&#039;d always imagined that there would be some fraction of the game that you&#039;d simply not tell us about, much like Teod outlined. </div><br>this sounds about right. think its worth a discussion on our end about where specifically to draw the line, but probably being vague about a couple of regions and a few beasties and omitting a few others that might drop too obvious of hints would do the trick. as so much of the game is about observation and creature interaction, spelling out &quot;this does this&quot; would be a shame, but thats probably easy to avoid as well.<br><br><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote"> One of the reasons why I asked about your thinking behind set-pieces was that I was curious about whether you intended to have scripted events, or whether there was some other kind of process you had in mind. Scripted events can be spoiled, but I don&#039;t think that emergent processes are necessarily so vulnerable to being drained of their surprise. </div><br>interesting question! most of what we&#039;ve done so far has been to organize the room geography, creature den placement, etc., in such a way that certain set piece-like outcomes are likely to occur. a simple example would be set-piece where you are first exposed to a new lizard type by having a pack of them chase you along a long bridge. easily done by having the lizards access to the player terrain be far enough away onscreen that the player has both visual alert and a running start before being in danger. it wont work perfectly, and sometimes not at all, but when it does it has a similar effect as scripting 4 lizards to spawn behind the player or something, etc etc. how feasible this is on a larger scale, we&#039;ll see. there are already plans for tools to make individual creatures more or less territorial, and then specify that territory, so that will definitely help structure set pieces while still being fuzzy enough to make the experiences unique.<br><br>a trade-off on all this that we have to be cognizant of is that there will certainly be people who get unfair / bad / boring experiences from us leaning on the cosmic dice roll, and they&#039;ll be like &quot;this game is broken&quot;. so balancing the emergent with the static so its at least generally functional will be some WORK.

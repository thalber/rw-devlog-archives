Something he could change or add to the world that would give him directions and persist between cycles.<br><br>Edit: Also, for easier navigation I suggest giving a bit of a gradient to each region, instead of a single color. So the garbage region could have green-ish, gray-ish and brown-ish zones - without clear borders, but with background color serving as an approximation of your position.<br></div><br>these are both goooooood ideas. spears already CAN function as markers that persist between cycles, so perhaps something that makes a spear more visible as a marker. we can do the second one super easy just with the color effects layer as we have it already.&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309162318im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/hand-thumbsup-r.gif" alt="Hand Thumbs Up Right" border="0"> <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309162318im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/hand-thumbsup-r.gif" alt="Hand Thumbs Up Right" border="0">

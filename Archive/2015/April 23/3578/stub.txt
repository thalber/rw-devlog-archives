WHOA! Thats pretty crazy to have such a large spread for an alpha demo D: Obv we&#039;d prefer people to see the finished product. But hey, Im just glad they didnt shred it!<br><br>@Princessa: they picked us up right after the kickstarter, so a little over a year now? but they are super chill and letting us do our thing, so im not surprised some ppl didnt notice!

Oh that&#039;s really cool! :D I&#039;m definitely on board with &quot;Acid Anime&quot;<br><br>Just wanted to say I&#039;m sorry about the lack of updates - I&#039;ve been doing level editor level editor level editor for almost a week. The next big thing is to start to stitch the regions together, but before moving from one huge technical project to the next I think I need to take a break and maybe implement a creature, so there should be a bit more updates for a while now &nbsp;<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309162318im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/hand-thumbsup-r.gif" alt="Hand Thumbs Up Right" border="0"><br><br>On the subject of maps - we don&#039;t really know! After the world has been put together we will be able to start playing the game *as it&#039;s meant to to be played* for the first time, and then the question on whether or not a map is needed will most likely be given a clear and definite answer. <br><br>James makes the worlds, and thus probably have a very different experience playing them from anyone else. I however can give some testimony of what it&#039;s like when I first get a region and get to play it in its current state, without a map.<br><br>The first thing you notice is that the regions are large and complex. But generally you don&#039;t get a proper perspective of <i>how</i> large and complex right off the bat. Because of some psychological mechanism I tend to take the same routes and gravitate towards the same areas, and it takes many playthroughs before I start discovering the peripheral rooms. On this last region I spent my first hour or so believing that I was exploring the region, just to a bit later find an unexplored passage and realize that I had in fact only been exploring a small more accessible fraction - the bulk of the region I still hadn&#039;t seen. <br><br>When it comes to finding your way and creating an internal map, it&#039;s both easier and harder than perhaps expected. I definitely don&#039;t have a clear memory of what the entire regions look like and what connects where, and because of the disconnected nature of the rooms it seems really hard to build a map like that in your mind. It&#039;s all pretty jumbled up in my head. However, some of the more routinely traversed routes get etched in. If you have a somewhere you know you want to go and you&#039;ve gone that route before, it&#039;s this weird thing where you couldn&#039;t draw a map of all the rooms to get there, but as you enter each room you sort of instinctively know what exit to take next. How that scales into seven hundred freaking rooms is up for question though.<br><br>It would certainly be more true to the atmosphere to not have a map, that&#039;s for sure. But, playability trumps. Another version of a map that could perhaps work while keeping a bit of the mystery is something that&#039;s basically just a bread crumb trail - it marks the exits you came from so you can at least reliably find your way back. If you backtrack a few rooms the trail would be erased, and when you go into some side corridor the trail would branch in that direction instead. Just an idea! This particular implementation would probably be pretty redundant though, as I think most peoples&#039; brains have a really good memory for &quot;that&#039;s where I originally came from&quot; when viewing a room.<br><br>A variation on the same theme would be an actual path finder that shows the way to either the shelter you emerged from or the closest shelter. That would however introduce the player to new routes and shortcuts that they might not have discovered by themselves, which feels a little cheap.

yep, totally! we&#039;ve been using this symbol here for shelters and it seems to work pretty well: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309162318/https://i.imgur.com/nfNl8bW.png" target="_blank">https://i.imgur.com/nfNl8bW.png</a><br><br>there was a suggestion that it just look like a regular shortcut until you discover the shelter inside, but eh seems fussy. if we want to do something like that we can just put a small room in between so it still takes a little more effort to discover from a main room or something.

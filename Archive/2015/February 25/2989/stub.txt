Thanks for the encouragement though, it keeps us going!<br><br>@Prinsessa you&#039;re doing water surface physics? If you want to I can see if I can dig up the paper I used to get this thing going. I think I found in google scholar.<br><br>I&#039;ve barely played the game since... forever, or at all, because it hasn&#039;t been a &quot;game&quot; for very long, but tonight I did a few runs. I encountered a situation I wanted to share with you because I want to brag about the game haha, but also because it spotlighted some of the goals we&#039;ve been going for, and I think it&#039;s relevant to the design process as a template of the sort of situation we want as much of as possible.<br><br>Not all playthroughs are as good as this, some are still janky and buggy and kills you unfairly. With that disclaimer, here goes the brag story:<br><br>So I was moving about in Chimney Canopy, an aerial region with a lot of vultures. I enter a room, and see a vulture just sitting up in the corner of the room, looking at a group of bats as they&#039;re swarming. It&#039;s a really cool mood to it, this huge predator just chilling out for a while, idly looking at its little buddies mill about. (It was all probably due to some AI bug, but that&#039;s beside the point lol).<br><br>I&#039;m like a deer in the headlights down in the other corner of the room. For a while it doesn&#039;t see me, but then its head turns and I see that it starts moving. So I just back down the entrance and leave the room. The last thing I see is that it unfolds its wings and take to the air, rather than pursuing me towards the exit.<br><br>In the other room, I pop out on a platform high up in the right corner. I&#039;m momentarily safe, but I know that the vulture has not forgotten about me. It was just sitting there, so evidently it has nothing better to do than chase after me. At almost the same time as I, a pink lizard enters the room through an exit in the lower left corner. I get an idea.<br><br>I deliberately show myself to the lizard. The layout of the room is such that there&#039;s a shortcut going from the lower part to the upper part. The lizard bites the bait, and goes in the shortcut to get up to me.<br><br>I have some knowledge it doesn&#039;t have though. The vulture is on its way. As the lizard reaches the top part of the room, I jump down from my platform and scurry under cover. A moment later, the shadow of the vulture swoops across the screen, and the lizard is startled. The lizard doesn&#039;t get away in time, and given the choice of a prey that is right in front of it (the lizard) and one that it can&#039;t see any more (me) the vulture goes for the lizard, snaps it up and takes to the sky. I&#039;m safe, both foes having been played out against each other.<br><br>The reason why I really liked this situation, and want to remember it, is because it defines what the rain world gameplay should be like ideally. The player is smaller and weaker than everything else, but by using wit and information advantages, the other creatures can be manipulated to your advantage. The situation relied heavily on the other creatures having relationships and interactions among themselves, contrary to only being aggressive towards the player. By being smart about it, I could turn two overpowered enemies into zero, without using any violence. <br><br>All of this is was heavily reliant on AI - as some of you might remember I&#039;ve been talking about &quot;trickability&quot;, i.e. the creatures being smart enough to be tricked or manipulated. It was really nice to actually see this play out, after all the work that has gone into it.<br><br>If the game has more creatures and more interactions, there will be more opportunities to do stuff like this. Using anecdotes like this, we can know what sort of behaviors to look out for, and then reinforce them. We still have a long way to go though - this sort of stuff should be the bulk of the experience, not a single occurrence that I&#039;m so stoked about that I feel the need to put in on the devlog haha!<br><br>But it shows that the gears are starting to turn, and that the idea we&#039;ve had is starting to be realized! Baby steps, but I&#039;m really excited about how the game will play 5 more creatures down the line!

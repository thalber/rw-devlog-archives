<b>Update 417</b><br>After placing a million sound triggers, I&#039;m taking another(final?) dive in the level editor. This time to allow for the placement of decals - pieces of custom terrain coloration.<br><br>Rain world has been a rather monochrome place, and it will continue to be so. However, we want to be able to spice up the occasional room with some color. This editor allows you to place art that is rendered into the environment as two dimensional color on the surfaces of the objects in the world.<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309173059im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/04/15/T85j2.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Note - not a scene from the game, just me trying out the coloration tech.<br><br>Still a few things to figure out. For example, the slight oily effect at slanted surfaces seems to have disappeared, I&#039;ll have to find where it went. Another challenge is to make the system backwards compatible. I want the shader to be able to process a level from the pre-decal era and just not render any decals, rather than being messed up somehow. If it can&#039;t do that, we&#039;d have to re-render all the 200 or so rooms we currently have, which would be a bad spot. Seems like I&#039;ll be able to avoid that though&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309173059im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/hand-thumbsup-r.gif" alt="Hand Thumbs Up Right" border="0">

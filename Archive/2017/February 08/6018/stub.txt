The difficulty being too low definitely isn&#039;t a problem, I&#039;d say. I&#039;ve played Rain World for years, and I still really struggle with certain passages - it&#039;s by no means a walk in the park. And I know the code and every little trick. We have been thinking about some kind of setting or similar going the <i>other</i> direction though, to enable less fanatic players to have some feeling of closure without necessarily see all of the cool stuff that&#039;s there for those willing to dive deeper. It won&#039;t be for this release though ~

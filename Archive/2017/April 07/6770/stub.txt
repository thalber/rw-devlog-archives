Maybe its a mechanism against species extinction which is there only for the purpose of compensaiting for all the near species extinction caused by the rain. And the rain is a nessesary evil/byproduct of the weather control system which is needed for the global commodity circulation of the&nbsp; abandoned,but still working, megastructure build by a former Type 1 civilisation (Kardaschow-Scale) which has &quot;evolved&quot; into Type 3 and left the solar system.<br>&nbsp;<br></div><br>i love this actually. let me know when you get to the end and lets discuss :O

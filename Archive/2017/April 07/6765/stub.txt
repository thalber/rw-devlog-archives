Oh on the subject of the map, if anyone is interested I&#039;ll go a little more in depth since im here.<br><br>We didnt JUST implement the &quot;sav map discovery through death&quot; because players asked, there was also some thought behind it ofc. Basically the map in the release version just wasnt working how we intended. Part of the function was to allow players to track their location and plan routes, etc, like a map does. But the other essential part was to show players where they HADNT been, so when they wanted to explore new territory they would know where to start.<br><br>We had thought that having the map progress be lost upon death would do this, but in fact when watching streamers play it seemed to have the opposite effect! Since the game is quite challenging, players were only really able to save their map progress along main lines through regions, and when they&#039;d explore side paths they&#039;d die and lose whatever cartographic progress they had made. So then when you look at the map its basically just a straight line going from region gate to gate. Not at all what we were intending!<br><br>Saving the map progress through death allows for the progress along side paths and etc to remain, which i think is a much better indication of &quot;path not explored&quot; than what was happening before. So all in all i think its a solid improvement!

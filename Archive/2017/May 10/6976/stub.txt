personally, im all for keeping the exploits in. its kind of just a slightly more extreme version of what the game is all about anyway.<br><br>also the new slugcat modes will each introduce their own flavor of new challenges, so I think we&#039;re all about keeping the &quot;standard mode&quot; where its at right now for the most part, and if we want to adjust things for the new modes (which we&#039;ll be doing anyways) it just adds more playability imo.

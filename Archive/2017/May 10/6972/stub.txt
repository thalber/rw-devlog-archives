The issue with the teleportation option is that player 2 would be teleported like *all the time*, as you generally switch screens every 5-10 seconds - would be very hard to get flowing gameplay that way!<br><br>Ohh speaking of exploits, do you guys know the Guardian flashbang exploit? If any of you are speed runners I&#039;d really like your input on that - I can as easily leave it in as take it out, but need to know what speedrunners prefer! Here&#039;s two ways I imagine you could think about it.<br><br>1) Take it out - it basically circumvents the entire game, and now that we&#039;ve seen it there&#039;s not much more to add. It would be more interesting from a speedrun perspective to take it out so you actually have to play more of the game, and the people who found this exploit will be forever remembered in the hall of fame.<br><br>2) Leave it in - taking out exploits as they&#039;re discovered is cheap, speedrunning is all about finding those and if you find them the reward should be yours!<br><br><br>

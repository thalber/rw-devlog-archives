Why is it windows only?<br></div><br>shaders, bro! While we are using unity as a rendering pipeline, the engine and everything else is 100% custom, and moving that from DX11 to OpenGL is still a time consuming process, especially since Rain World has hundreds of custom shaders and textures that will need to be fitted. Its just Joar doing the programming, so launching on 4 OSs simultaneously was impossible. But once we have the PC/PS4 versions launched we&#039;ll be able to turn our attentions to other versions and give them the attention they deserve!<br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309212111/https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.msg1323075#msg1323075">Quote from: Teod on March 16, 2017, 01:19:12 PM</a></div><div class="quote"><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309212111/https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.msg1322875#msg1322875">Quote from: jamesprimate on March 15, 2017, 01:59:26 PM</a></div><div class="quote"> <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309212111im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/epileptic.gif" alt="Epileptic" border="0"> <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309212111im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/epileptic.gif" alt="Epileptic" border="0"> <span style="font-size: 20pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>RAIN WORLD PREORDERS LIVE ON STEAM</b></span>&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309212111im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/epileptic.gif" alt="Epileptic" border="0"> <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309212111im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/epileptic.gif" alt="Epileptic" border="0"><br><br>~~&gt; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309212111/https://store.steampowered.com/app/312520/" target="_blank">http://store.steampowered.com/app/312520/</a><br></div>Preorder&#039;d. <br><br>Also, guys, you are in the phase of distributing review copies and all that stuff, right?

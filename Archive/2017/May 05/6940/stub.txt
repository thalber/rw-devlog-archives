This has been an incredibly frustrating process and im so disappointed that it has taken this long, sorry. We shipped patch code for the PS4 version literally 2 days after the game launched, and basically its been back and forth between us, ASG, the people doing the PS4 port, and sony for the past month. <br><br>There was a &quot;finished&quot; patch version that got through the process a week ago which was intended to go out, but somehow aspects of the sleep screen UI got messed up (<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308174533im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/huh.gif" alt="Huh?" border="0">), stuff thats only apparent later in the game, and its just luck that I happened to triple check before it went out. <br><br>So now thats being addressed. Hope is that it can be out early next week, but there has been so many bugaboos with this PS4 patch that i dont want to make any official announcements until its done, tested, and in my hands. <br><br>Doubly frustrating because it takes time away from us working on the new content! Every time a new version of the patch comes in, its like 3 days solid of me and the ASG QA team running it for bugs.<br><br>Anyway! Pardon the vent, but thats whats up with that.

if anyone is interested, Joar and I did a nice longform audio interview with Erika from big cheshire grin:<br><br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308171407/https://bigcheshiregrin.com/2017/03/02/clear-skies-ahead-an-interview-about-the-journey-to-rain-world/" target="_blank">https://bigcheshiregrin.com/2017/03/02/clear-skies-ahead-an-interview-about-the-journey-to-rain-world/</a><br><br>she really knows her rain world stuff, so it was fun to talk to chat with someone on that level! i think there is video of it too somewhere, but seriously nobody needs to look at our dumb faces for an hour, lol

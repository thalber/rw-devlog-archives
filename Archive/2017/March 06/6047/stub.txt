by the way! if anyone here does the reddit, i think were going to try to organize community stuff over here: <br><br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308171407/https://www.reddit.com/r/rainworld/" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/rainworld/</a><br><br>rather than have new players sift through 300+ pages of old devlog, etc etc. So join us if you would like!

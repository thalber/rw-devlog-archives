Ahh streams have been going surprisingly well! I was so nervous since it&#039;s a pretty slow paced game that takes a while to unravel. Obviously the tutorial and first region , getting an understanding of the controls and mechanics etc., is the most boring part. But watching Etalyx&#039;s stream and the dude made 4hours (!!) in the first region seem fun. Tay is an expert slugcat and has played the game for years at pax so she got through to the 2nd region much quicker, but still I think my playtime estimate is WAY off. Adult Swim is sending out info that it&#039;s ~30hr to beat, but that estimate is based on getting through the first region in like 15 minutes tops, lmao. In my 8hr runs it takes me 1minute and 30 seconds max to get to the 2nd region, lol! <br><br>Anyway, enough rambling! We&#039;re stoked though&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308171625im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/laughter.gif" alt="Corny Laugh" border="0"><br><br>Re: gates and death penalty - yeah it can definitely be harsh before you understand the mechanics. There are almost always shelters near the gates, and once you get into the rhythm, know to look for those first and stock up enough food for the journey before leaving, progress becomes much more viable.<br><br><br>Re: tutorial creature as a vibe killer - definitely a concern for us! 2 things: firstly, beyond the early tutorial it will only help you if you want to follow it. You can throw rocks at it to scare it away and it will leave you alone, or if you simply don&#039;t follow it&#039;s directions it will appear less and less. Also, no spoilers but you do part ways relatively early in the game.<br><br><br>Re: why do some people have the game early - for hype, reviewers and press! In addition to being huge for marketing, streamers also act as a 3rd round of QA so we can see how people are responding to difficulty, what they are liking and disliking etc. Allows us to make some final touch ups to squeeze in before the release and early patches / updates.<br><br>Cheers friends!!! <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308171625im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/hand-anykey.gif" alt="Hand Any Key" border="0"> <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308171625im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/hand-joystick.gif" alt="Hand Joystick" border="0">

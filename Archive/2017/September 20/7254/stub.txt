But an issue is that now Rain World is in 7 different languages, so there might be some time with localization before we can blast it out to steam. Fingers crossed though!<br><br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308175026/https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?PHPSESSID=dm5egl1li4betnhn2fnj71b3i6&amp;topic=25183.msg1354430#msg1354430">Quote from: Teod on September 19, 2017, 01:20:29 PM</a></div><div class="quote"><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308175026/https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?PHPSESSID=dm5egl1li4betnhn2fnj71b3i6&amp;topic=25183.msg1353356#msg1353356">Quote from: jamesprimate on September 14, 2017, 07:17:55 AM</a></div><div class="quote"><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308175026/https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?PHPSESSID=dm5egl1li4betnhn2fnj71b3i6&amp;topic=25183.msg1353130#msg1353130">Quote from: MrToasty on September 12, 2017, 09:27:55 PM</a></div><div class="quote">I was thinking it would be awesome to have to unlock new arenas (0g or dark or water) by at least traveling to those places ingame.&nbsp; Maybe you would also have to unlock the creatures in sandbox mode via killing them ingame.<br></div>we&#039;ll post more details soon, but its pretty much as you describe.<br></div>Honestly, I think this is not the best way to do it. Multiplayer and singleplayer Rain World have different stakes and different pacing - they&#039;re almost two different games. And they fit two different audiences. By hiding multiplayer features behind singleplayer progression you would limit the enjoyment of people who would enjoy it the most. I think there should be an option to unlock all of the multiplayer stuff from the multiplayer itself, or people will just download everything-unlocked savefiles.<br></div><br>definitely a valid point, though we have our reasons (which imo will be pretty cool once they are discovered). i think with the sheer volume of multiplayer stuff were including, as well as the fact that it can all be unlocked in any difficulty mode, should be enough to mitigate any off-putting feelings on this. there will be a ton of playability just from the start, and honestly i think it would be pretty overwhelming if everything was included from the beginning.

After many long trials and tribulations... the Rain World PS4 v1.01 update is finally live! Details below! <br><br><i>Hello friends and slugcats! We present to you PS4 patch #1: Rain World v1.01<br><br>This patch is intended to accommodate some early player feedback and polish assorted rough edges on the various game systems, etc. These were all low-hanging fruit that we think improves the player experience without taking anything away from the concept of the game. Rain World should be an existential experience: unforgiving and even occasionally unfair. But it should be the jaws of a Lizard that gets you or the terrifying Rain, not some ragdoll physics wonk or design oversight! <br><br>This patch puts the PS4 version at parity with the current PC v1.015<br><br>Gameplay improvements:<br>* “stuck in holes” fix - disconnected exits will no longer snag you<br>* subtle backlit slugcat in low visibility swimming situations<br>* quicker turning around in tunnels<br>* larger lung capacity while swimming<br>* nerfed the more intense waterfalls in Shoreline to prevent repeated drownings<br>* more pearls near Scav tolls in Garbage Wastes<br>* more food in central Garbage Wastes<br>* more food in central Shaded Citadel<br>* more karma flowers in world<br>* karma gate requirements on the Shaded Citadel, Drainage System and Underhang side were lowered to prevent players becoming stuck in challenging regions<br>* food / karma flowers regeneration now ticks forward on deaths (helps eliminate stuck / starvation situations at low karma)<br>* players will now keep map progress between deaths (Id say 99.5% of people asked for this)<br>* map now features gate karma symbols and shelter icons when locations are discovered<br>* karma depletion on game exit removed if done within 30 seconds of sleep cycle<br>* full karma drop on exit bug fixed (that was a brutal one, sheesh!)<br>* intro cinematic is now skippable<br>* upon respawn after death, shelter doors cycle through opening animation faster<br>* many many minor room fixes<br><br>Stability improvements:<br>* Save file corruption fixed<br>* map loading bug fixed<br>* gate crashing bug fixed, as well as multiple other rare crashing bugs<br>* assorted additional stability improvements<br><br>Thanks for your patience!! <br>--RW Devs</i>

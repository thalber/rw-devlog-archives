James was thinking along the same lines but I have to admit I actually discouraged it&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308174740im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/shrug2.gif" alt="Shrug" border="0"> We get into these feature creep loops where I add a a thing so James has to add a thing to mirror that thing, then I have to add a couple of things to make that stuff work, repeat and fade... And update already has plenty of good content so we want to get it out! Soo, while it&#039;s still up to James of course I don&#039;t think a new region is what will happen, but we&#039;re talking about some additions to the current regions.

100% correct!<br><br>Somehow weve found ourselves in the truly bizarre situation of having a super hyped game entering the high polish marketplace of 2017 that was in fact originally made on software designed for creating SPREADSHEETS. We have all manner of insane dependant legacy weirdness and hand-coded-workarounds-that-became-essential-aspects that you wouldn&#039;t even believe me if I told you. The fact that this games works as well as it does (aka fairly solid with some noticeable strangeness here and there) is incredible and due entirely to sheer brute willpower and dedication. <br><br>So, yeah sorry if certain aspects aren&#039;t as slick as one might expect!

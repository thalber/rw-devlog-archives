ah! i should probably explain that a bit more before it gets taken out of context. <br><br>the design decisions werent &quot;bad&quot; of course. they were exactly the right decisions for rain world. its just many dont make sense from a perspective of &quot;gamedev as a business&quot; (and even sometimes the perspective of &quot;videogames as entertainment&quot;). rain world is all about hidden depth, being unable to distinguish the barriers of the game, blurring that line of projecting into what you see and real AI behaviours, a world (and narrative) thats much larger than the player character experience, the surprise of discovering things that are totally outside your established frame of reference and perhaps even the frame of reference of other players, etc etc etc. but that also means that 90% of the development effort is spent on content that only maybe 2% of players will ever see. thats terrible ROI, lol.<br><br>and of course imo thats what makes it interesting! we were perfectly happy doing things that nobody else was foolish enough to do. anyway, ill get off this train of thought but thought it might shed a little light on some of our behaviours.

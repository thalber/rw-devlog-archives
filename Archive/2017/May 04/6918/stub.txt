<b>Update 534</b><br><br>Whew, lots of work these day! I&#039;m doing some multiplayer stuff (basically an arena mode) and difficulty modes. The idea for the difficulty modes is that you&#039;ll be able to select a slugcat to play as, and they&#039;ll come with a few different perks and/or slight variations to the world. For the first update I&#039;m gonna do 3 of them ~ Yellow (easy), White(normal) and Red(hard). White will ofc be just like the current game, whereas the other two have slight variations. <br><br>Here&#039;s Red carrying an extra spear on its back:<br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308174419im_/https://giant.gfycat.com/NeedyMagnificentChick.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>The extra spear goes outside of the two &quot;slots&quot; of the hands, meaning that you can have it simultaneously as carrying two other objects (and potentially a fourth one in your tummy). The spear is stashed and retrieved similarly to how you swallow stuff, but requires a significantly shorter button hold. I think there should perhaps be some more animation to the slugcat&#039;s arms when putting/retrieving the spear, will get to that later today.<br><br>This is a pretty significant boon to the player, but don&#039;t worry, playing as Red will be very very challenging! Red is basically for the action-oriented players, and you&#039;ll need that extra spear.<br><br>Playing as Yellow on the other hand is going to make your life easier in a bunch of ways compared to White.

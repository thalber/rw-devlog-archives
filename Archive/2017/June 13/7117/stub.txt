this is all good discussion and things ive been pondering myself. my perspective is that theres no reason not to have some of the new creatures at least be *possible* to find, either through lineage or some out of the way rooms, in the easier modes. I certainly dont want all to be accessible from yellow and were not going to change the overall experience of white too much, but i think it would be cool that the knowledge one gains of the new creatures when playing through yellow and white would give you a big advantage experience-wise when going into red. if that all makes sense!<br><br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309164157/https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?PHPSESSID=bk19lpelpuckm5hmrbsd0tda02&amp;topic=25183.msg1339480#msg1339480">Quote from: JLJac on June 13, 2017, 12:41:33 AM</a></div><div class="quote"><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309164157/https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?PHPSESSID=bk19lpelpuckm5hmrbsd0tda02&amp;topic=25183.msg1339342#msg1339342">Quote from: Dinomaniak on June 12, 2017, 03:47:59 AM</a></div><div class="quote">I&#039;m very curious on the dropwig interaction with other creatures, like a white lizard or a bird, or even the nightmarish jump-crawler creature two pages ago.<br></div>Me too! Just taking it out of the incubator environment and into the real game and will start checking how the interactions play out. <br><br>@crankykong, trust me, when it&#039;s *somewhere* in a room and you aren&#039;t primed to look for it, it&#039;s not that easy to see at all! In the single player context you won&#039;t even know whether it is in a specific room or not, and have plenty of other things to worry about ~ so in the tests I&#039;ve done it definitely seems surprising enough.<br><br>Actually the bait items are intended to be a little bit of a help to the player ~ from a lore perspective it&#039;s a &quot;smart&quot; thing for the bug to do, but from a gameplay perspective it&#039;s acting more like a help to the player. Like, &quot;why is this item here, that seems out of place... ohhhh&quot;. The bug is heinous actually, so camouflage isn&#039;t really the main thing here - once you know where it is, you still have a real problem to deal with.<br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309164157/https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?PHPSESSID=bk19lpelpuckm5hmrbsd0tda02&amp;topic=25183.msg1339369#msg1339369">Quote from: i.i on June 12, 2017, 07:29:17 AM</a></div><div class="quote">I&#039;m here to throw my hat into the hardcore mode only legendary beasts crowd!

Having the difficulties have a distinct playstyle flavor could be really cool! <br></div>I&#039;m leaning this way myself and I think James is too, but having them exist in some optional corner of the world would add content to the experience essentially for no effort, which is hard to pass on! Listen to me, I&#039;ve become all &quot;content output per work hour&quot; - I&#039;m basically EA at this point &nbsp;<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309164157im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/shocked.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0"><br><br>@Manray as a matter of fact there&#039;s an unannounced creature that would fit into this category, and the needle worms are sort of there too! I agree that it tends to get a little predator heavy ~ which is because passive creatures by their nature have less interactions. To be EA again it&#039;s the same amount of effort but with basically nothing &quot;happening&quot; to the game, why they tend to not get as high a prio. In Rain World most critters are both predator and prey though, so the distinction is a little blurry! If you&#039;re talking about slugcat food sources in particular, a bunch of those have actually been added &nbsp;<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309164157im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0"><br></div>

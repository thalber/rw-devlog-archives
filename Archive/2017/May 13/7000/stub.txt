They&#039;re very dangerous but very unaggressive, is the idea. You really have to wrong them badly for them to extrude their creepy narwhal tooth, but once they do they&#039;re brutal.

Because compiling has started to take a million years I&#039;ve created a slim version of rain world in which I make the creatures, then I move them over to the main engine and integrate them with the ecosystem ~ these are still in step #1 there, so the exact interactions aren&#039;t set yet - but I have the basic idea!

ahhh thank you thank you ! thats funny, im actually really good friends with Rich AKA Disasterpeace so for some reason its hard for me to think of my dude who i get weird pizza and watch seinfeld reruns with as being &quot;my favorite soundtrack&quot; or a huge musical influence, but theres no question that he is. to be honest, hes the person who suggested i do game music in the first place! so yeah, huge influence both from Rich&#039;s music and as a person. i owe him a ton. cheers to Rich! <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170608061303im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/toast-r.gif" alt="Toast Right" border="0"><br><br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170608061303/https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.msg1336862#msg1336862">Quote from: 12LandsBoundlessSpace on May 27, 2017, 10:02:25 am</a></div><div class="quote"><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170608061303/https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.msg1336854#msg1336854">Quote from: Manray on May 27, 2017, 09:37:52 am</a></div><div class="quote">All of that was done in a single update...<br></div>Almost.

WTF is Polybius? This is some of the most intense music I&#039;ve ever heard.<br></div><br><br>Ahh! You are digging deep, haha. That was written early on, intended to be for the first Daddy encounter. Early on we had some vague ideas about Superstructure and the Leg where we&#039;d have rooms seal off and you&#039;d be stuck in them with some monstrosities until figuring out some puzzle or another, so I made some more traditionally scripted extreme horror music to go along with that. But that concept clashed a bit with the general concept of the game, so we quickly abandoned it. Now only remnants such as Polybius remain! <br><br><br>

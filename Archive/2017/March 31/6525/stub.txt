unless im misunderstanding your question: just climb the center pole, get off to the left, then pounce from the left ledge to the right!<br><br>i think you can also leap from the center pole and grab the bit of broken right-ish pole, then swing yourself over. but i am the level designer, so i WOULD say that, wouldnt i.

Undecided</div><br>yeah, actually! i mean if we were aiming for review scores this game certainly never would have been made. its entirely some weird, personal, arty experiment, with all the baggage that entails. the fact that anyone is looking at ALL is amazing.<br><br>we&#039;ve had some incredible high praise from people who really understood what we were going for with the game and were able to take it on its level and see past the rough edges, and unsurprisingly we&#039;ve also had some dings from reviewers who didnt have the patience to spend 60hr wandering around in some terrifying, occasionally impossible lost land. and thats 100% okay, because the game is both of those!<br><br>from my perspective, id vastly prefer that the right person buy this and play it deeply because it resonates with them than 10 randos buying it because of some number rating.<br><br><br><br><br><br>One thing I will say though is that from some of the big site reviews its pretty clear that a number of reviewers didnt make it out of the first region. I completely understand time constraints and definitely this game is a lot to deal with if you are a journalist under deadline (and certainly were low on the totem pole of reviews to invest time in), but even so it would be reviewing the game based on experiencing like... 3% of the games content. Which, idk, seems a bit strange of a position to be making bold proclamations and rigid numbered reviews... but we arent the first to experience this situation and ceraintly wont be the last<br><br>edit: lol, and apparently im not alone in thinking this:<br><br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308172141/https://twitter.com/EightBitDylan/status/846387991996239872" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/EightBitDylan/status/846387991996239872</a><br>

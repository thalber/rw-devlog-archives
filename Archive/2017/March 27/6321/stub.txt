ohh! Sequence breaking already!<br><br>If you go the Drainage System route, you&#039;ll skip some of the early tutorialization, which is perfectly fine for a seasoned professional such as yourself. Also its a bit higher difficulty route, but very possible! The streamer 8BitDylan was able to make it through this route pretty well.<br><br>Drowning is definitely a concern.

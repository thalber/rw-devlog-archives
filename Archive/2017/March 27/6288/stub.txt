Woah these reviews are mixed! The best ones are amazing and the worst ones are brutal <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309163734im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/shocked.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0"> Yeah the game is unfair, that&#039;s true - and yeah, we&#039;ll definitely be trying to smooth out the experience a bit. Adding more shelters would probably make a big difference for example. Need to have this crazy mix of input cool down a bit before making decisions though!<br><br>I actually have no idea what happened to the polygon reviewer - there isn&#039;t any mechanic that sets you back further than where you started to my knowledge! It seems to me they just had a really sour experience with the game - we&#039;ve seen the same thing with streamers, some have a bit of luck, figure some things out, feel rewarded and appreciate it. Others have bad luck 5 times in a row, fail to figure some key element out, get frustrated early on and (understandably) gets into a mood where they can&#039;t really appreciate it even after they actually get to move forward. That said I think their frustration is real and valid of course, and it&#039;s still 100% on us! Work ahead, but for now let&#039;s just see where stuff is as the dust settles!

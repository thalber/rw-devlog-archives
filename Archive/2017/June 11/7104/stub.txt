Yeah sadly we&#039;re put a little bit on hold right now&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309164157im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/undecided.gif" alt="Undecided" border="0"> We&#039;re trying to make the most of it though by continuously adding stuff so that when the update comes out it will be really cool. I&#039;ve been adding creatures (some of which not announced) and it&#039;s a pretty good number now actually! Depending on how generous your definition, there are either 5 (with the most conservative definition) or 8 (if you&#039;re more forgiving and for example count adult needle worm and baby needle worm separately ~ which would make sense to do if you consider the lizard colors &quot;different creatures&quot; I think!) new creatures coming up, and a ton of other stuff as well, including the multiplayer/arena mode and the different playable slugcats. So I think the update will be pretty good! Here&#039;s to hoping we&#039;re allowed to move forward and get into QA etc soon!<br>

eh, yeah, honestly the alpha humble thing isnt something we really wanted to be doing, as we&#039;d much prefer that people experience the game as intended. you&#039;ll notice we dont advertise it or link to it or anything, but its there for people who really want to find it. otherwise we&#039;d have people still sharing the old 2012 lingo alpha, which is infinitely worse, lol!<br><br>and fwiw the reasoning for the closed beta was similar actually. we really want people going into the game fresh, especially the fans! going in with knowledge of some of the spoilers changes the players whole perspective of the game (imo), so having a QA/beta team thats under heavy NDA and lock-n-key is very nice. this may seem weird in 2017 indie game world, but was important for us!

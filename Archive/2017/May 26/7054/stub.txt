We now have a Discord server, a sort of offshoot of the main one, which you can follow for updates, or even if you want to help with development: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170608092457/https://discord.gg/qS3ZedY" target="_blank">https://discord.gg/qS3ZedY</a><br></div><br><br>YO thats very very cool! I wont lie though, im intentionally *not* going to look at anything like that until we&#039;ve wrapped up our own expansion plans, as i dont want to have that in my head even subconsciously (if that makes sense!) <br><br>But once we finish up our plans, we&#039;ve discussed bringing the rain world level editor to steamworks and letting yall go wild with it. (and by &quot;go wild&quot; i mean &quot;suffer the horrible tedium and instability that we did&quot; lol) No timeline on that of course, but just letting you know that we&#039;re keeping yall in mind&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170608092457im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/toast-r.gif" alt="Toast Right" border="0">

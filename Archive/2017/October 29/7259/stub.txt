Hi! Sorry about the radio silence, I&#039;ve been churning insanely on this update. Step by step Rain World is becoming closer to the vision, and an important part of that is of course multiplayer...<br><br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308175026/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc_z-jCHq-A&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308175026im_/http://i68.tinypic.com/w82psz.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a><br><br>In the video you can see some of the new creatures as well! We made sure not to show anything that hasn&#039;t made its way to the internet already, but actually the update has a few completely unrevealed creatures as well.<br><br>Alright, back at it! We&#039;re quite close now, so it&#039;s maximum crunch. See you soon!<br>

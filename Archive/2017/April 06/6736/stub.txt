@ crankykong<br><br>This is definitely not the final patch/update, we just wanted to get the things that were the quickest to fix out there... quickly.<br><br>Agreed that the controls need polish, but some of it could be solved with better tutorialization as well - which couldn&#039;t make it in this time around because of the time frame of translating it. Just want to address some of your valid concerns there though, as stuff that we plan to fix and/or tutorialize better!<br><br><br><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">-the button for charging up leap jump and the button for falling of of cliffs and poles should really not be the same button!!!<br>-controls which constantly let you fall of off cliffs and ledges,when you try to leap jump.</div><br>The leap jump is done by crouching + holding jump - you don&#039;t need to hold down to leap jump. On the fall-through platforms, you can tap down once to get into the crouching position - from there you can either hold jump to leap, or tap down again to fall through the platform. On smaller platforms, you can tap down quickly (not hold) to get into the crouching position, and then leap from there (although this is definitely a little finicky and something we&#039;ll look into!)<br><br><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">-controls which constantly let you roll down ledges,when you try to duck in a pipe on a Floating platform,because for some strange reason slucgat sometimes tends to do a barrel roll of the ledge, when you duck instead of going into the pipe you want to duck into. </div>Accidental rolling fixed in this patch!<br><br><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">+The transition of slugcat between horizontal poles and vertical poles on their crossing lines is slow and clunky as hell! </div> <br>Noted, will look into! For now, a tip is to jump between the poles instead!

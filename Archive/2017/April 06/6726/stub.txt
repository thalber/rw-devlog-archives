<b>Hello friends and slugcats! We present to you patch #1: Rain World v1.01</b><br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308173651im_/https://i.imgur.com/uXfvAPO.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>This quick patch is intended to accommodate some early player feedback and polish assorted rough edges on the various game systems, etc. These were all low-hanging fruit that we think improves the player experience without taking anything away from the concept of the game. Rain World should be an existential experience: unforgiving and even occasionally unfair. But it should be the jaws of a Lizard that gets you or the Rain, not some ragdoll physics wonk or design oversight!<br><br>Gameplay improvements:<br>* “stuck in holes” fix - disconnected exits will no longer snag you<br>* subtle backlit slugcat in low visibility swimming situations<br>* quicker turning around in tunnels<br>* larger lung capacity while swimming<br>* nerfed the more intense waterfalls in Shoreline to prevent repeated drownings<br>* more pearls near Scav tolls in Garbage Wastes<br>* more food in central Garbage Wastes<br>* more food in central Shaded Citadel<br>* more karma flowers in world<br>* karma gate requirements on the Shaded Citadel, Drainage System and Underhang side were lowered to prevent players becoming stuck in challenging regions<br>* food / karma flowers regeneration now ticks forward on deaths (helps eliminate stuck / starvation situations at low karma)<br>* players will now keep map progress between deaths (Id say 99.5% of people asked for this)<br>* map now features gate karma symbols and shelter icons when locations are discovered<br>* karma depletion on game exit removed if done within 30 seconds of sleep cycle<br>* full karma drop on exit bug fixed (that was a brutal one, sheesh!)<br>* intro cinematic is now skippable by holding start / esc<br>* for players having issues with Grey Screen of Death and starting the game from sav files, you can now entirely skip loading the into by holding &quot;s&quot; when pressing &quot;New Game.&quot; hopefully this helps until we have a real fix!<br>* many many minor room fixes<br><br>Stability improvements:<br>* map loading bug fixed (was causing the corrupted savs, ugh)<br>* gate crashing bug fixed<br>* stability improvements<br><br>etc.<br><br>Next steps: More patches and content is on the way, of course! We would like to see how this current round of bugfixes land before digging into further issues, as we have a feeling that these might solve a lot of the problems we&#039;ve seen. But of course if you could keep sending in those bug reports and sav files that would be fantastic and hugely beneficial.<br><br>Thanks to all for feedback and please keep it coming! Let&#039;s all get through this tedious fixing and tweaking so we can get rolling on the fun stuff: new content!<br><br>&lt;3<br>--Rain World team

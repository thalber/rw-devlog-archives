Not a bug, but rather a potential second chance opportunity! The slugcat has an invisible health meter (all creatures do), and if you are grabbed by a creature but not quite dead yet, the game allows for the possibility that you could recover if that creature drops you or if you are able to snag a spear and free yourself, etc. Generally how this works is if a lizard grabs you and begins to drag you to its den, then other lizards (or creatures) attack it to try to snag you as an easy meal.<br><br>The idea behind it is mostly show off the creature agency, allowing you to witness the churning ecosystem a bit more as the creature drags you screen from screen, and also reward patience in a way that suits the game: you never know what will happen<br><br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308171752/https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?PHPSESSID=ql5jbqs605l2ckku4sdpkvrnr3&amp;topic=25183.msg1324126#msg1324126">Quote from: sergiocornaga on March 22, 2017, 03:01:36 AM</a></div><div class="quote">Totally understand if you don&#039;t want to do this or don&#039;t have time, but I was looking through the last hundred or so pages of this thread and noticed this video had been switched to private:<br><br><br><iframe width="640" height="385" src="//web.archive.org/web/20210308171752if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/MhppIJDWOgM?fs=1&amp;start=" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><br>It would be great if it were changed to unlisted so it could be seen in this thread!<br></div><br>Done! and ill do one better too.

Each creature has a web of other creatures that are its prey, generally with at least one or two creatures that are considered tastier than the slugcat! But that said, depending on your playstyle this may not be the most noticeable thing. The world is large and you can only view whats on your screen!

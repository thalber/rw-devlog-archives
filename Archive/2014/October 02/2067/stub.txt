@iambored2006 &amp; Christian,<br>Yeah, it&#039;s a sneaker. All the other creatures have a limited FoV, except the player. The idea is that you don&#039;t question the player&#039;s omniscience as much, as it stems from the weird duality of player/avatar that comes from having a third person perspective. The slugcat is in the world and shouldn&#039;t be able to see through walls, but you&#039;re looking at it all from the unfathomable third dimension, so you know things you shouldn&#039;t know. This is actually the core aspect that makes the game fun as well. You look at the lizards and you see what they do, and can kind of imagine what they might know or think, as you try to play around that. Your ability to see through walls is also pretty much the only leverage you have on the lizards, if they were able to ambush you from behind a corner the game would be virtually impossible. I could easily add a mode where other creatures are invisible if there&#039;s not an actual line of sight from your avatar to them, but that would essentially break the core mechanic. It would be extremely scary though hahaha! So it might be fun to try.<br><br><b>Update 319 </b><br>Made the flies able to move between rooms, and exist in abstract rooms. James and I had a little talk, and decided that bats (yes, I&#039;m using fly and bat every second time) didn&#039;t need to be saved as individual creatures in abstract space. There&#039;s really never no need to identify one fly from another, a bat is a fly is a bat. Also it seemed ridiculous to save the individual positions of ... idk... 10 000+ flies on the entire world map, especially as they are all moving the entire time. So instead I created a system where they are saved as just numbers, per node in each room.<br><br>As always when I&#039;ve spent the day doing something boring I&#039;m going to try to appease you with saying that it&#039;s a generalized system that can be applied to any creature from here on! It&#039;s a boring update, but it&#039;ll make fun updates be more frequent in the future! We call this system Quantified Creatures, as they are not remembered as individuals but just reduced to their quantity. I think this system can be cool for some small decorative insects and the like as well.<br><br>The system supports free movement between rooms, abstract to abstract, abstract to realized, realized to abstract and realized to realized. <br><br>One thing this system is capable of doing which I&#039;m looking forward to is to create extremely large migrations through the world map. We have been talking a bit back and forth about whether or not bats should migrate - it might not be a good idea for gameplay reasons. If they don&#039;t though, some other creature definitely should. My idea is that I could have huge quantities of the creature moving between abstract rooms, as this would be no harder than just shuffling numbers (minus one in this room, plus one in this room). Then when you move through the rooms and view them one by one, as many of the creatures as the computer is capable of could be shown moving around. You could follow the flock and see them consistently existing in many rooms, moving in the same direction, suggesting an epic world-map-scaled movement with thousands of creatures, even though not all of them are necessarily realized at a time.<br><br>James has really been killing it with the level editor 0______o He&#039;s been sending me some pretty amazing looking levels. Looking at his levels, I&#039;ve come to realize that he&#039;s way better at composition than I am haha... Look at those hills in the wide one, that&#039;s some pretty damn smooth line work for a musician! Still I&#039;ll be necessary in the creation of these 200+ (<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229090357im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/shocked.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0">) rooms, because actually placing the tiles demands knowing them all by heart. So it seems we&#039;re zoning in on a setup where James creates the geometry and I decorate it and give it the RW aesthetic. Which seems like a perfect match! But nothing is settled for sure yet, we&#039;ll have to see how things develop as we get into the focused world building phase. Until then I should probably fix the level editor so it can output larger levels ...

I think that in fictional universes, you can&#039;t really speak of realism per se. I mean, look at it. But you can talk of in-world consistency. My philosophy is something like this:<br><br>* Make simple, understandable rules<br>* Stick to the rules<br>* When it&#039;s necessary to make an exception, try to<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;-Promote the exception to a rule. If the exception is in many places, and consistent, it&#039;s not an irregular oddity any more.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;-Demote, minimize and hide the exception. A fallback solution, as it&#039;ll always be an exception, but better than nothing.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;-Clump exceptions. Many exceptions in one &quot;weirdness zone&quot; is less jarring than having them everywhere. <br><br>So, rain world creatures have certain rules going for them, one of which is inability to see through walls. This applies to all of them. This is a gameplay rule, they have &quot;canon&quot; rules as well, such as that they need to hide in a hole when the rain comes, or aesthetic rules, such as that they consists of several moving parts but few, flat colors. <br><br>The player creature is by necessity an oddity, because it&#039;s controlled by the player. So I&#039;ve sort of been gravitating towards making the player creature an exception cluster. The ability to see through walls is one of those exceptions.<br><br>Then there&#039;s other stuff as well, such as aesthetic choices, I wouldn&#039;t want the sprites to pop or fade into existence when you see them, as I try to keep HUD and game graphics as separate as possible - essentially my goal is that everything you look at should either be very clearly an object that *is there* in the physical game world, or something that is extremely clearly a HUD overlay which is not in the world (promoting the exception to rule and clustering it). So these kinds of decisions have developed together with gameplay decisions into what I&#039;m thinking of as the current design idea.<br><br>And simplicity has a certain weight as well! If the simplest, default mechanic of a 2D game is that you can see everything on the screen, that should be a slight bias to keeping it like that as well, in my opinion. Otherwise you&#039;re adding stuff, and whenever you&#039;re adding stuff you need to be careful that it&#039;s stylistically in line with everything else.<br><br>Sorry it got a bit long! I&#039;m not defensive against your question, I just like to talk about this stuff <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229090357im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0">

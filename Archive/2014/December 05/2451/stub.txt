That sounds like a good setup!<br><br>Hahahaha yeah, the bats sometimes play at the water surface, and several times I&#039;ve seen the leeches get them &nbsp;<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141211031309im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/cheesy.gif" alt="Cheesy" border="0"><br>It&#039;s really funny, because the bat will try to fly a little bit but the leech is way too heavy. I should probably add a weak &quot;afraid&quot; relationship between then bat and leech.<br><br>Edit: Gif! Added the little afraid relationship, as you can see by the first bat which almost gets caught and then freaks out and gets out of there.<br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141211031309im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2014/12/05/KyraR.gif" alt="" border="0">

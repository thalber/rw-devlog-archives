Wooow!

Your game has been voted as the best devlog of 2013 by the TIGSource community. Here is your trophy.<br><br><div align="center"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150101012640im_/http://eigen.pri.ee/images/best_devlog_2013_trophy.png" alt="" border="0"></div></div><br>It&#039;s super awesome that you appreciate the devlog so much. It started out as a thing more or less for myself to log my progress, and it makes me very happy that it has developed into this thing that&#039;s a source of enjoyment to other people. Now that I know how appreciated the devlog is, I will definitely try to step up and give it some more love myself - I&#039;ll try to keep it more consistent, informative and entertaining, and minimize the update slips and neglect it has seen at times. <br><br>I&#039;m not really sure if you guys nominated it because of the <i>devlog</i>, or because of the <i>game </i>being devlogged. In either case I will try to make both the game and the devlog as good as I possibly can, in order to make this project enjoyable both prior to the release of the game and after it. I have noticed that many people are interested in technical details, and I&#039;ve been lazy in answering those questions. That I&#039;ll try to change. Thanks again!<br><br>In regards to the kickstarter stuff, thank you all for helping out. What you write seem to make a lot of sense, and you guys seem to have a very good understanding of what makes those projects sink or swim. James and I have been dividing the work in a way where I focus more on the strict core of developing of the game, and he is taking care of pretty much everything else (not that I let him do his work in peace). So this input of yours is most relevant in relation to James&#039; work - I don&#039;t really know much about this stuff - and I&#039;ll be interested to hear what he makes of it. Thanks for your engagement in the project!

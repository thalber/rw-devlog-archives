I used out paramaters - they&#039;re awesome! I&#039;m learning so much these days my brain almost can&#039;t take it &nbsp;<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150101111825im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/droop.gif" alt="Droop" border="0"> Why oh why didn&#039;t I start with C# earlier?<br><br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150101111825/http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=39261.msg1001959#msg1001959" target="_blank">Here&#039;s the test project I&#039;ve made this last week!</a><br><br>The game has quite a bit of Rain World-like stuff going on in it when it comes to the physics, because I wanted to try that out.

Also I didn&#039;t want to have a lot of junk in there from when I didn&#039;t know very basic stuff, and I did dodge a few of those bullets - for example I wrote myVector[0] instead of myVector.x for a while, and similar stupid things. Not to say that I&#039;m not <i>still </i>doing stupid things that I&#039;ll pull my hair over in a few months, but at least a few of them are out of the way.<br><br>I think I&#039;m ready to start the porting, actually! &nbsp;<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150101111825im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/hand-thumbsup-l.gif" alt="Hand Thumbs Up Left" border="0"> <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150101111825im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/epileptic.gif" alt="Epileptic" border="0"> <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150101111825im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/hand-thumbsup-r.gif" alt="Hand Thumbs Up Right" border="0"><br><br>I still worry about a few things. <br><br><hr><br>MonoDevelop is slow on my computer, and comes up with stupid autosuggestions once in a while. The Unity console is s**t - it&#039;s not in any way a stranger to just <i>skip </i>logging stuff whenever it feels like it. That could probably be circumvented by creating a custom logger that logs to a text file, maybe? <br><br>In director I could &quot;watch&quot; an instance and see all of its properties change in real time as the game played. Whenever the game froze because of an error, it would go to where the error occurred in the code, and show what every variable was at the time. If I had for example an array of object instances, I could expand each of them and see what its properties where at. I had a console in which I could write snippets of code and execute them, if the game was running or not. This new environment is clearly inferior when it comes to those debugging assets.<br><br>Vector graphics and bezier curves, I can do without them but it would be cool to have them. At least simple shapes like square/circle.<br><br>I haven&#039;t tried sound.<br><br>I haven&#039;t tried importing graphics (this might be a problem because Futile only takes its weird texture thingies) <br><br>I don&#039;t know if I can retrieve the color of a pixel into my code with perfect accuracy. (I save level data in the level image file encoded as colors)<br><br>Futile doesn&#039;t perfectly respect the pixels. An edge that is 2 pixels wide might end up 1 pixel wide in the game (look at the lives bar in the HUD of space worms). This isn&#039;t a super big problem for Rain World which isn&#039;t very pixel art-centric, you won&#039;t see if a perfectly white silhouette is one pixel off. But it&#039;s still very annoying, and might become a real problem with for example the level graphics.<br><br>If a graphic is shrunk substantially, it will invent edge smoothing colors despite the texture being set to &quot;point&quot;. You can see this on the very small rocks in Space Worms. This can be avoided in all Rain World scenarios I can think of, but is still a very annoying flaw.<br><br>The game becomes HUUUGE! The code and the graphics of space worms are together less than 200 kb, still the published game occupies <i>147MB</i> before compression and 15MB after compression. Whaaaat?<br><br><hr><br>Maybe I should try to make Space Worms work in Monogame as well - just to see if some of the above problems are absent there? Maybe someone can cue me in on that right away?<br><br>Thanks again for helping me!

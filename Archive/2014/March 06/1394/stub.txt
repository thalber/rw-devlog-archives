Thank you Juan and Jonbro for sorting out some of my concerns. Perhaps I&#039;m a little too harsh at this point considering that I&#039;ve far from explored all the options. <br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150101111825/http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.msg1001892#msg1001892">Quote from: dancing_dead on March 06, 2014, 03:48:24 AM</a></div><div class="quote">did you, by any chance, have massive white, empty spaces in the tilesets/spritesheets/whatever?<br></div>This could very well be it. I&#039;ve located the weight to a file called &quot;resources.assets&quot;, which points towards this explanation. Why does it bake everything together in an &quot;assets&quot; file that&#039;s much bigger than the original image file when it could obviously load a normal png just fine before publishing? Also, there is a way to load image files on the fly right, that&#039;s going to be super crucial for Rain World level loading. <br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150101111825/http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.msg1001892#msg1001892">Quote from: dancing_dead on March 06, 2014, 03:48:24 AM</a></div><div class="quote">You can take a look at Hotline Miami to see how that looks, their sprites rotate and maintain the same &quot;pixelishness&quot; at any rotation.<br></div>Hahaha this is literally the worst in my opinion &nbsp;<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150101111825im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/tongue.gif" alt="Tongue" border="0"><br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150101111825/http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.msg1001892#msg1001892">Quote from: dancing_dead on March 06, 2014, 03:48:24 AM</a></div><div class="quote">Vector graphics/Bezier curves is a tricky challenge, you might need to roll your own custom vector renderer thing with a limited vector graphics subset or something (I hope you don&#039;t need, like, full Illustrator graphics specs support?), but with dedication and time, programming can yield the most wondrous results.

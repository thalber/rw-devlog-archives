Oh wow, you threw that together just like that? That&#039;s amazing! Yeah, I see what you mean, the scale definitely does seem a little weird. The reason why I have it looking as it does is mainly that I&#039;m trying to keep the color count down in order to give it a &quot;pixel art&quot; look rather than &quot;shader mania&quot;, but that&#039;s obviously a battle that&#039;s slowly and surely lost. You do have a good point in that multiple layer water would mimic how the backgrounds are constructed, which might give some consistency to it.<br><br>The scale issue is actually not that big of an issue to me personally. Might look a bit too small at times, but this is a weird cartoon universe where things aren&#039;t really that pinned down. I honestly couldn&#039;t tell you how tall a slugcat would be next to a human, which is kind of the point, because it never is next to a human - it lives in its own realm. The weird scale of the water reminds you of that a bit, which I&#039;m not entirely opposed to. Then again, I&#039;d prefer it being ambiguous to it being visually well-defined that the slugcat <i>is </i>small as a raindrop, because if you forced an answer I&#039;d probably have to say that it&#039;s closer to an earth-mammal in size than a droplet of water. <br><br>Difficult stuff. But yeah, note taken. Right now I&#039;m pretty happy to leave one week in shader land behind for a little while, but I&#039;d be surprised if I didn&#039;t return to it. If we&#039;re doing some ocean-inspired areas your water would obviously be much more fitting, and I think James have some plans like that. <br><br>I&#039;ve also been thinking about maybe having some reflections in the water surface - by now the body of water below the surface has gotten much more shader love than the surface, which is basically just a colored sheet. So... we&#039;ll see. Water round 2 might bring some changes. Thanks for your input!<br><br><b>Update 348</b><br>Made it so that creatures can be in dens. I had to mess around a bit with this because it means that a creature is in a room, coordinate-wise, but also not in the room as in that it can&#039;t interact with other creatures in the room. It seems like things are working out fine though, I&#039;ve been able to have a lizard enter a den in a loaded room, as well as move to an off-screen room and enter a den there, in abstract space.

I forgot you have a copy of the old alpha OST! Haha. Well this is a good question for you then: which tracks do you like best from the alpha music?&nbsp; The scope of the game has changed quite a bit since then, so who knows how much of that we&#039;ll wind up using, but always good to hear what people like :D

You managed to make it look pretty though, so I&#039;ll get over it <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141223131329im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0"> My only gripe would be that the water behaves very rubbery when you dive in, like it&#039;s jelly you&#039;re swimming around in rather than water. The swimming itself looks really cool, and I think the slugcat being darkened while submerged works well.<br></div><br>Yeah, me neither - and for a while we did talk about having the water extend towards the bottom of the screen - as if you were watching the level stick up above the surface, from a distance. It gets weird very quick though, because this whole platformer perspective thing doesn&#039;t really work if you try to think of it in 3D. If you saw the surface, and the level stick up out of it, you&#039;d all of a sudden feel like you&#039;re viewing the creatures from a distance - which is weird, because it uncomfortably places the viewer in the scene - and 2D and 3D spatiality collide. Also, when looking at a normal level, you&#039;re kind of seeing the <i>inside of walls</i>, maybe? Doesn&#039;t really make sense to have a cut-in-half building like that stick out of an ocean and view it as through binoculars... <br><br>Then come the practical stuff - if what you see was the surface of the water, you wouldn&#039;t be able to see what was going on beneath it. And when the surface is above the horizon? (Yeah, the game has a &quot;horizon&quot; it uses for the pseudo 3D stuff, it&#039;s 1/3 down from the top of the screen). In the end, the aquarium approach was only the really thing that made sense. And I&#039;ve kind of learned to like it, it makes it feel like you&#039;re looking at a little model of a room or something <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141223131329im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0"><br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141223131329/http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.msg1075837#msg1075837">Quote from: Rebusmind on October 23, 2014, 03:50:12 AM</a></div><div class="quote">I love the effect.

Imagine how tense that would be. You dive underwater, and don&#039;t realize a lizard is nearby because it&#039;s hard to see and kind of camouflaged against the other dark things underwater. And then a flash of color in the darkness and a dark shape starts rushing towards you...<br></div>I haven&#039;t had a proper talk with James yet, but I&#039;m kind of leaning towards not having many creatures that are both land and water dwelling - it&#039;s easier and feels cleaner to have some separate (vicious!) water fauna that will eat whatever falls down there. But it&#039;s all open for discussion right now - currently I&#039;m just trying to get the damn water to work haha!<br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141223131329/http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.msg1075837#msg1075837">Quote from: Rebusmind on October 23, 2014, 03:50:12 AM</a></div><div class="quote">I love the effect.

And also the jelly like qualities of the water, making it seem as if surface tension is really strong. The jelly I&#039;m not so happy about, but I kind of like that the water looks like it&#039;s small and close, a little bit of confusion over the scale of things seems fitting when you don&#039;t want to pin stuff down too much. Obviously the slugcat isn&#039;t half an inch tall and taking a bath in a droplet, but that little effect serves as a reminder that we don&#039;t actually know all too well what we&#039;re looking at.<br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141223131329/http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.msg1075841#msg1075841">Quote from: Vadinci on October 23, 2014, 04:14:40 AM</a></div><div class="quote">By the way - and maybe this has been answered before and I missed it - what is the penalty for dying in the game? Do you start all over from day one with no flies?<br></div>The classic idea, which we&#039;re still holding on to, is that you&#039;ll be allowed to restart the &quot;cycle&quot; - a cycle is basically a level, except it&#039;s not geographically contained, so more like a &quot;mission&quot; or whatever name you want to use for &quot;chunk of play&quot;. In a cycle you wake up from hibernation, go out and try to hunt for food, and need to return to hibernation before the rain gets you. Hibernation acts as save points, meaning that if you die you get to retry that cycle.

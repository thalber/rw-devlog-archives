<b>Update 345</b><br><br>Finally I got to color - I needed to rewrite my way of handling palettes (and thereby also my shaders) so that each palette is its own png. Feels much more reasonable. I think that we can also do gradient changes between palettes using this system <i>without </i>writing a shader for it - the palettes are 32*8 textures, and I think that a palette swap effect could be achieved by just doing copy pixels on the currently active one in the CPU, the GPU wouldn&#039;t even know anything was happening.<br><br>That said, I&#039;m feeling a bit weird, because everyone has been telling me that performance is super important when writing shaders... And my experience has been that I can get away with anything. Maybe my computer has a very fast graphics card? Pretty much whatever I do they seem to run perfectly fine, the only problem is that they tend to sometimes not work at all, which seems like a different issue...<br><br>Anyhow, messed with the palette stuff, and made it so that the palettes contain positions for water coloration as well. I also added an option that the water can be &quot;behind&quot; the foreground, as James requested being able to do puddles and pools without necessarily having the entire level look submerged:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141219152429im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2014/10/24/QVhmP.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Water colors are still WIP, but at least more reasonable. Creating palettes is for some weird reason one of the most time consuming activities in making this game hahaha! I can tweak those colors for weeks before it feels right - so I&#039;m pretty sure that the water is going to go through a few such iterations as well.<br><br>On top of that I managed to make it so that Unity is more comfortable with my shaders - it doesn&#039;t give error messages or anything, and it actually agrees to build the standalone! But the shaders are still all white, so that&#039;s going to need more messing around.<br><br>I&#039;ve also tried to look into some wave equations in order to make the surface less jelly-like, but it&#039;s all written in physics or math language that I&#039;m not really literate in <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141219152429im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0"> Maybe if I give it a serious go I can achieve some sort of breakthrough - after all I&#039;m not trying to do an accurate physics simulation for calculations or anything, I just want it to look somewhat correct.<br><br>Happy weekend!

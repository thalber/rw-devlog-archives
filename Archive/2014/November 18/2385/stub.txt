It feels artificial in a game that (as far as I&#039;ve seen) is entirely organic.<br><br>I&#039;d like to revisit the idea of bugs to show a player there&#039;s a shortcut nearby. It might be interesting to use a swarm of bugs settling or being agitated as a player gets close to designate a shortcut.<br></div><br>A main theme at play here is the contrast between artificial and organic. You might have noticed how the environments are very industrial, but the creatures living in them are not. So the digital vibe from the shortcuts are not a problem to me because of <i>that </i>reason. What is a bit problematic is that we want to keep working machines to a minimum - you&#039;re supposed to look at old machinery, but not interact with it a lot. The shortcuts as they are are obviously an exception to that.<br><br>I&#039;m not the hugest fan of the bug idea because it would introduce a living element to every room, always. The palettes of moods we can create is limited if we can&#039;t have just an empty room with nothing living in it. As the world is rather barren, and creatures are generally the only objects allowed to move, creatures become natural focal points with a lot of gravity to them. I want to keep it that way - if you spot something living you should be cautious and intrigued - living things shouldn&#039;t be scattered all over every level.<br><br><b>Update 357</b><br>WIP death rain. Doing it as a shader this time around, which is kind of difficult.<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141211122412im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2014/11/18/0BpT7.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Hm, the gif capturer really went hard on this one... With the full framerate, it appears denser, and has a downwards movement going through it - making it look like it&#039;s falling rather than flickering between different images, hehe. The unpleasantness of it comes through though!

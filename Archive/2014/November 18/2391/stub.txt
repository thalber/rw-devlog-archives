<b>Update 358</b><br><br>Game over screen finished enough for now!<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141211122412im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2014/11/19/9Vo68.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>The sound is pretty important for this one. As the level becomes darker, there is a violent rain sound that becomes louder and louder. When the screen suddenly turns black, there&#039;s a drum-like sound, and then everything is quiet. This contrast makes for a pretty dramatic effect! Then, in the quiet, you hear the first couple of rain drops hit the ground, and then the real death rain comes very suddenly, with a deafening noise. In the lingo version this transition was really sudden, but here I have given the transition to the death rain a little more build up - I don&#039;t really know which one is preferable. It was kind of cool to have the wall of white rain suddenly just <i>be </i>there, but this build up approach seems more organic.<br><br>The next thing I&#039;m moving on to is flies swarming behavior. The bad news about this is that I need to re-visit the dreaded <i>Prebaked AI Code</i>, because flies need to save the distance to their hives within the same framework as they use to save distances to room exits. Going in there again this time the code has been behaving <i>mostly </i>civil though, so with some good luck it might not be too bad. If I can just create a special case for the fly creature template to make it store a few extra dijkstra maps per room, that ought to do it - and I see no reason why that shouldn&#039;t work out.

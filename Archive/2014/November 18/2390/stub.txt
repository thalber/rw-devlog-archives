James, I know you&#039;re kind of in the zone with the level editor stuff now, but once you re-surface I&#039;m pretty sure people would be interested in a more in-depth description of your creative process with the music. Like, I tend to describe how I make everything down to the tiniest detail, but with the music we&#039;ve pretty much only published finished results so far. Would it be possible to make some step-by-step display of how a piece of music/ambience comes into existence? I&#039;m not all that sure how you&#039;d display something non visual like that... But it would be cool to provide a bit more detail in that area too!

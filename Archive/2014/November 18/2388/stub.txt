death rain is looking suitably brutal! you seem to be all in on shader black magick, very nice. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141211122412im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/wizard.gif" alt="Wizard" border="0"><br><br>as for the long going shortcut debate, i think it will make a LOT more visual sense in actual game context than in the default rooms Joar is using for test purposes. wait and seeeeee! coloration and brightness is certainly something worth considering though.<br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141211122412/http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.msg1083979#msg1083979">Quote from: Caspar2000 on November 18, 2014, 04:01:19 AM</a></div><div class="quote">Seeing the youtube with music adds very much to to the experience of this devlog. I read the log often and I am used to seeing the gifs only. I would love to read (or hear) a bit about the development of the music. It gives so much depth to the scenes. <br></div><br>thank you! i feel the same way, ahah. yes there is a lot to talk about for that O_O, but we will probably wait until we have the audio engine implemented before going too much into it here. right now i have about 100 tracks in various stages of completion, but they are kind of on the shelf for now until we have the regions constructed and the specific scenarios / narrative stuff all nailed down tight. dont want to put TOO much cart before horse, etc. <br><br>But long story short for all of that, the focus is going to be on atmosphere, audio being a blend of ambient textures and &quot;music-like&quot; elements woven through, with more &quot;song-like&quot; elements used to set mood for specific locations / scenarios. I imagine &quot;washes of sound and strange music&quot; that weave in and out of the gameplay. Also we have a notion for some procedural-esque properties with how the audio is handled, so perhaps you never quite hear the same audio environment twice.<br><br>Anyway, hope that answers the question a little, or perhaps tantalizes for future interest!

<b>Update 317</b><br><br>Hey, remember these guys? (Blue for your viewing convenience)<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229083427im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2014/09/30/0Bk1.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>I&#039;ve had a lot of fun with the flocking behaviors of these. The creature is ... eh... half bat, half (butter?)fly, and they&#039;re able to switch between a flapping bat flight and a buzzing insect flight - this time around I explored that aspect even further by having them engage in some kind of swarming ... dance? ... where they use the buzzing flight for a slightly longer time, hovering in place. The framerate of the gif doesn&#039;t really make those rapid wing movements justice, but you get the idea. They actually flap once per frame, so 40 times per second, but the graphics engine I&#039;ve got going extrapolates between frames, meaning that you&#039;ll see as many frames as your computer can render. Her&#039;s the flapping in SUPER SLOWMO:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229083427im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2014/09/30/EK5I.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>You might notice that some of them flap more with one wing than the other - that&#039;s when they&#039;re trying to move in the horizontal dimension.<br><br>And here&#039;s a slugcat ambush in regular moderate slowmo (no actual interactions yet, but the fleeing behavior is in):<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229083427im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2014/09/30/GrIvd.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Edit: Oh, yeah, in that last gif there&#039;s actually a floor, but it isn&#039;t visible because I&#039;ve turned the background off. In case you wondered why the slugcat is hitting solid air all of a sudden.

Especially like the little mini flaps in between... You should release it for the iPhone, it has one entire more dimension of freedom than flappy bird, so it should do ^2 the $$$ according to simple maths!<br><br><b>Update 318</b><br>Took it a bit easier today, and did stuff such as commenting some code. Might as well do it when it&#039;s fresh in memory. Also cleaned up the bat flight animation a bit - for example you might notice that the rapid flaps in yesterday&#039;s gif are upside down - they should be quick when going down and slightly slower when going up. Also the wings tended to be tilted upwards too much an not enough downwards, so I messed with those angles some and applied a Mathf.Pow to make the movement less stiff and linear.<br><br>Other than that I started implementing some bat grabbing. When I first just hooked the creatures up with the default grabbing code I got this behavior, which struck me as hilariously confused:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229083427im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2014/10/01/MofGQ.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>&quot;Is it stuck to my neck!? It&#039;s stuck to my neck right... If I stand very still maybe it won&#039;t bite me...&quot;<br>And the bat is like &quot;Whoops stuck to a neck here. Guess I&#039;ll just keep on flapping&quot;<br>&nbsp;<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229083427im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/cheesy.gif" alt="Cheesy" border="0"><br><br>After a bit of tweaking it started to look better though:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229083427im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2014/10/01/icqEG.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>It might not be very visible in these gifs, but the hands stretching out to reach for bats are in as well, but as I haven&#039;t gotten around to making the slugcat direct its gaze it doesn&#039;t look very good yet. Instead of looking at the bat and reaching for it it&#039;ll just stare blankly at the camera with the hand moving around in the background. Once the face movements are in I&#039;m sure it&#039;ll look cool though.

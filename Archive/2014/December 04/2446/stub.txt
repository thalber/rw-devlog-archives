Yeah, the idea of leeches came up when James and I discussed the implications of the recently added water. We really liked swimming around, but we wanted the water to be an exception from ordinary gameplay - we didn&#039;t want the game to become a Swimming Game. So we decided to add some creature that is in most of the water, and makes it a bit uncomfortable and dangerous to be there.<br><br><b>Update 370</b><br><br>Swimming just became a whole lot less comfortable&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141211031309im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/shocked.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0"><br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141211031309im_/http://giant.gfycat.com/OffensiveVapidEidolonhelvum.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>I originally planned to make them more as a fish/leech hybrid, with a bit of a head, but when I got the triangle mesh for the body in I liked the leechy softness of it so much that I went with a more conventional leech. Too boring? I could spice them up a bit with some more alien element as well.<br><br>They&#039;re not entirely done, but pretty much so. I want to have them crawl along floors if they end up out of the water, and they should air-drown after a little while as well. Also they need to respond to the rain cycle, and they need to forget targets that have been out of the water for a little while. They should also probably give up on a target that has been dead and leeched for a while, or one single dead creature will make an entire body of water safe for ever. <br><br>Aaaand the big, boring thing - I need to write some kind of framework for &quot;a thing being stuck to another thing&quot; in order to have these leeches follow you between rooms. That same framework would then be applied to make bats stick on spears, and then it&#039;d probably make sense to throw out the old &quot;spear stuck in creature&quot; hack and use this new thing instead. <br><br>I thought I could make a special case for only spears, but I&#039;ve come to realize that the game has quite a lot of things being stuck on other things, so the engine probably needs to be able to handle that.<br><br>Back to the leeches - they don&#039;t actually hurt you themselves, they just weight you down. If enough of them attach you&#039;ll drown. On one hand I like this, because it creates a very visual &quot;health&quot; system where you can see how many of them are attached - 4 or 5 is usually enough to do you in. Once you get out of the water your &quot;health&quot; is reset by the leeches detaching themselves. The problem with this system is that 1 or 2 can never be an actual threat, only an annoyance as they impede your movement a bit.<br><br>Maybe that&#039;s not too big of a problem though. Especially as I imagine a situation with 1 or 2 of them as being pretty rare, in most cases I imagine a body of water as either having leeches or not, and if it has them they&#039;ll appear in schools of 10-20 or the like.<br><br>Catch ya later, I&#039;m off to feed some lizards to the leeches&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141211031309im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/evil.gif" alt="Evil" border="0">

Can you multiply with bools? C# generally get mad at me when I try...<br><br><b>Update 135</b><br>Just wasting endless amounts of time on this custom shader haha! Right now I&#039;m a little shader crazy, so there are probably more effects going on than in the final product. But I&#039;m certainly learning and having fun!<br><br>Little taste of my light engine as of today:<br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141228135528im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2014/05/09/NftZo.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141228135528im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2014/05/09/SEtHu.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Can you imagine how I went through all that trouble to make that weak little color shift happen? Crazy. Still I think it brings a lot of &quot;location feeling&quot; - the shadow helps you understand what you&#039;re looking at as a volume, which enhances the illusion of being in a space.<br><br>As you can see the shader is now also able to vary the palette, among other things. It can also fade the light up and down, the rainbow effect and effect colors are in, etc etc. I&#039;ve played with a little distortion to make it look wet, but maybe it&#039;s more distracting than cool. I could potentially keep it but dial it down a bit. So many possibilities!<br><br>I think that when I&#039;ll want more effects, such as a rain effect, a fade between palettes and so on, I won&#039;t incorporate them all in one shader. Rather I&#039;ll write a shader for each effect, and just switch. That way I won&#039;t be able to have all of them at the same time, but they will all be more concise and therefor faster and compatible with older machines.<br><br>

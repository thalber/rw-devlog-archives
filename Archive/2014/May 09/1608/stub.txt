In my case that means everything turns white, as the shader is no longer hooked up to the palette texture. Hardcoded colors work.<br><br>I&#039;d set the textures through code, but the only way to access shader properties is through the <i>material</i>, and I just can&#039;t find the material(s?) of my Futile object(s?)... You can go Futile.instance.renderer.material, but then it just says &quot;this object has no renderer attached to it&quot;. Unity says that 13 materials exist, but applying the setting to all of them doesn&#039;t seem to work.

DATE/YEAR PRESUMED, MIGHT BE WRONG

<b>Little update: bad week edition</b><br><br>Had some minor disasters hit the rain world team the past few days. Joar is out sick, so he&#039;s taking some time off, and I got a little taste of rain world in real life with... my apartment flooding <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141211031329im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/cry.gif" alt="Cry" border="0"> Yikes! All is well now, but things may be a little slow this week<br><br>So anyway, in the mean time let me go into what I&#039;ve been up to with the levels and world design. We&#039;ve made some solid progress into the second region of Rain World, &quot;Drainage System&quot;, which as the name implies is a kind of pervasive sewer that spans the near-surface subterranean and connects a few key regions. It is huge rusted pipes, aqueducts and contained water elements, etc., to creep and crawl through. <br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141211031329im_/https://i.imgur.com/iJ1i7MCl.png" alt="" border="0"><br>(Larger: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141211031329/https://i.imgur.com/iJ1i7MC.png" target="_blank">https://i.imgur.com/iJ1i7MC.png</a>)<br><br>We&#039;ve been spending some time getting the mood right, showcasing Joar&#039;s work with the water physics, ambient water lighting, the new waterfall element, etc., and i think it has paid off hugely, producing a really distinct vibe<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141211031329im_/https://i.imgur.com/Y8rQ4JOl.png" alt="" border="0"><br>(Larger: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141211031329/https://i.imgur.com/Y8rQ4JO.png" target="_blank">https://i.imgur.com/Y8rQ4JO.png</a>)<br><br>and then of course we infest the area with nasty leeches! <br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141211031329im_/http://i.imgur.com/2phC9zCl.png" alt="" border="0"><br>(Larger: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141211031329/https://i.imgur.com/2phC9zC.png" target="_blank">https://i.imgur.com/2phC9zC.png</a>)<br><br>Lizards will also be in this area, but probably confined to the parts closest to the surface, as they are afraid of water. (with very good reason&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141211031329im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/evil.gif" alt="Evil" border="0">) <br><br>Heroically, even after getting sick Joar was able to send me a new tileset for larger &quot;inside pipe&quot; environments, so I&#039;ll be experimenting with them the next few days. This is the principle area that will have &quot;water surrounded by tiles&quot;, so Im trying to make the most of it!<br><br><i>edit: after posting one of the screenshots and then previewing the post, i noticed a tiling goof and corrected it. so thanks???</i>

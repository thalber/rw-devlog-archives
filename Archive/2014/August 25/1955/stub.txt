oh wow those look absolutely incredible. the black gradient has is very &quot;deadly creature&quot; feel to it, like a poisonous frog or snake. If you dont use that coloration for all the lizards (i vote for that), then perhaps as a distinction for the larger &quot;adult&quot; versions of each breed.

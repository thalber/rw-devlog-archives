<b>Update 296</b><br>Got a triangle mesh up and running for the lizard&#039;s tail. It&#039;s based on the player&#039;s tail, and was thus somewhat painless to get working. Paving the road has finally started to pay off. Also added a new function to my triangle mesh class - vertex coloration. <br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141227124052im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2014/08/25/dOQxF.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Because I&#039;ve assigned color to the vertices, and the idea of this object is that triangles can share vertices, there are no sharp edges in the shape and the colors are stretched and bent like supposed to. When bent at very sharp angles you can see some edges, but I think it&#039;s acceptable for now.<br><br>I&#039;ve also created a body for the lizard, which works similarly but also uses circular graphics as well. Basically it&#039;s a circle at each body segment with stretchable quads connecting them, expect it&#039;s not because there are also intermediary circles between the segments to smoothen the curve, and the very first segment is only rendered as a little stub because this is where the head is going to be.<br><br>The color might be a bit dark against the balck background - my monitor is brighter than most - but if you look at it at an angle you&#039;ll probably be able to see something&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141227124052im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/tongue.gif" alt="Tongue" border="0"><br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141227124052im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2014/08/25/AjhJq.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>A little slow motion and tossing around in there as well to show how the tails behave. I don&#039;t think all lizards will have colored tails like this - I kind of like the black tail - but maybe one or two might have something like it.

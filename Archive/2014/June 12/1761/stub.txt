It&#039;s a bit frustrating, because it&#039;s very hard to write about my progress when it comes to pathing. Like, half a day might be &quot;it seems to prefer using a ledge drop here, even though I told it to use a climbing connection. Is this because the heuristic is wrong, the sorting algorithm, or because it disregards the sorted order all together?&quot;<br><br>Excitement!<br><br>Today though, I have made some pretty cool progress. I now have a class called &quot;Creature Template&quot;, which holds a few data points about a specific breed of creature and which is accessible from anywhere in the game. The creatures defined right now are Slugcat and Lizard, and at this point it only holds some pathing preference info on them.<br><br>Still, this has some potential. An example - today I made one implementation of what I call a &quot;connectivity mapper&quot;. It&#039;s a thing applied to a room - it goes by every entrance to the room times every other entrance to the room, and pretends to be each of the creatures drawing their data from the creature templates. Then it paths between the entrances using that creature&#039;s pathing stats (can I climb on walls or not? Do I prefer climbing to running?) and decides if that path is traversable, and saves its cost to an array.<br><br>The result - for any room any creature can know if it&#039;s able to pass through it just by doing a quick lookup. My idea is to use this in particular for abstracted creatures moving in offloaded areas, but more on that when I get to it.<br><br>This isn&#039;t the only thing the creature templates can be used for though. Anything that might need to be known of another creature that&#039;s common to its entire breed can be accessed through this generalized system. For example I could hook each creature template up with a list of &quot;prey creatures&quot; and &quot;predator creatures&quot;. Then when a creature encounters another I wouldn&#039;t have to make a hardcoded event for their interaction, I could just have the creature ask &quot;does this species eat my species&quot; and if so it can initiate a fleeing behavior.<br><br>I hope for it to be a huge asset when working with AI, as in decision making AI, not just path finding. In an encounter a creature could easily check if, for example, another creature is able to fly or not, and make decisions based on that. <br><br>Creatures could be assigned tags such as &quot;poisonous&quot; etc.<br><br>The main difference here is that instead of everyone just having their individual stats, the species themselves are entities.<br><br>So that&#039;s cool! Now back to path finding!

Haha these are great questions and discussion! Jusst so Joar doesn&#039;t have to go back through and answer all of them:<br><br>* Yes, the concept is that rain kills by battery, pummeling and smothering anything that gets in its way (like a huge natural power sprayer is kind of the idea), but its def true that does seem to not be terribly extreme since the game playing audience is used to &quot;acid poison lava void levels&quot; sort of thing. So we&#039;ll need to make sure the threatening &quot;water = dangerous&quot; theme is carried through to this new traversable form to. <br><br>One thing is that you will often encounter light rains in the game as a warning, building up very obviously to the deadly downpour, so we are thinking of keeping that same mechanic with the water: safe when relatively calm, but then can build to deadly rough waves and storm when the Death Rains come, before being pummeled AND drowned.<br><br>* as for the another world style tentacles, prettttty much? unless we want CRAZY feature creep, we&#039;ll want to have a &quot;reason&quot; to limit the scope of what the cat can do in the water to a fairly shallow reach (for now at least), so we&#039;ve talked about having some SCARY WEIRD SEA THINGS lurking down there to do just that. There have been a few loosely defined water region creatures in our &quot;design document&quot; (LOL) for a while, but this will be more of an elemental, unspecified thing im guessing. Unknown things moving around deep under the sea is probably the scariest thing ever, so I feel like this will be amazing for mood. Joar&#039;s water distortion effect already terrifies me, so im SUPER looking forward to seeing what he can do with this.<br><br>Im SO excited that the water regions are working out. You dont even know. It&#039;s been something we&#039;ve been talking about for a long while, and from my perspective its necessary to complete the rain cycle motif. It ties into a few other things which are now possible because of this, like a puzzle piece being put into place. Got big plans for this!

<b>Update 343</b><br>Messing around with slugcat swimming... James and I are discussing this from a game design perspective as well. However, diving is turning out to be so much fun that I think it&#039;ll just have to be in the game... But maybe in a limited way - like, you can dive down, but you&#039;ll have to be skillful about it or you&#039;ll drown very easily. It all needs to make sense with the &quot;rain kills you&quot; theme as well, if the slugcat is perfectly comfortable under water that whole thing seems a little less viable. But, all those questions aside, the simple aspect of controlling the slugcat in the water is turning out pretty good! I&#039;ll gif you when I have some bubbles.<br><br>Also, the shaders keep messing with me -.- Sometimes when I open the editor, they work, sometimes not. Now it&#039;s <br>&#039;variable/member &quot;scrPos&quot; has semantic &quot;WPOS&quot; which is not visible in this profile;&#039;<br>does anyone have any idea how you make something &quot;visible in the profile&quot;?

Hahahaha hi everyone! I think my idea for the rain has been that it&#039;s like... yeah, the &quot;fire hose to the face&quot; analogy is pretty much it - like, a combination of pummeling and drowning. And yeah, water totally have a lower terminal velocity than that&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141223133821im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/whome.gif" alt="Who, Me?" border="0"> I think that you can&#039;t even call this a &quot;fantasy&quot; universe though, it&#039;s way more removed from our reality than that. It&#039;s more of a &quot;cartoon&quot; universe, or something like that.<br><br><b>Update 344</b><br><br>Swimming!<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141223133821im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2014/10/23/KYF21.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>This has turned out to be quite fun - to the degree where my productivity suffers because I just have to fill this and that level with water and swim around in it. <br><br>When swimming you have a &quot;swim power&quot;, some sort of momentum, which can be made to increase by doing certain movements, such as changing your angle. This means that just holding a direction isn&#039;t always the most effective way to move, you need to work with the water a little bit. If you bump into a wall you lose your momentum - so generally when you&#039;re under water you want to stay clear of the walls, which is trickier the faster you&#039;re going.<br><br>Swimming comes in two modes - surface swimming and deep swimming. The surface swimming is generally pretty lame, the slugcat will just keep its head up and you can steer left or right. What it does have is the ability to do a little hop by pressing the jump button, enabling you to maybe reach for some pole or ledge above you. Underwater swimming is faster (if you work up momentum) and more fun, but will be dangerous in one way or another. You have some buoyancy pulling you upwards, so you can do some pretty fun stuff by swimming down and then come up through the surface fast. If you have really good timing, you can manage to press the jump button during the few frames you&#039;re in &quot;surface mode&quot;, get a little extra momentum from the mini jump, and do a pretty sweet jump up into the air.<br><br>I still haven&#039;t gotten around to doing anything about the coloration of the water, but I think it&#039;s going to be pretty straigh forward as the entire underwater environment is basically just a gradient between two colors - so it&#039;s just a question of picking two colors that fit the above-water palette. <br><br>As you can see the slugcat is made dark when submerged... I have tried a few other things as well, such as having it be the original color but with a multiply overlay, or similar. Any solution with the actual colors visible turn out to be less cool though, for some reason. I think it&#039;s because when everything under the surface has the same colors it really feels like a different &quot;realm&quot;, whereas if the original colors are visible it just feels like a blue overlay. The problem here is that it&#039;s harder to see your player character, and also that in a multiplayer scenario it might be hard to keep them apart, if several players dive down simultaneously. Still it kind of <i>is </i>that visual obscurity that makes for the effect, so idk... What do you guys think?

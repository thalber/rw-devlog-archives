one thing joar and i were talking about earlier is the difference in stride between the lingo lizards and these. <br><br>previously, locomotion was done via a sort of faked &quot;ghost pull&quot; situation, meaning that the lizard walk was basically the body being dragged along the ground. now in the new version there are nice actual legs to walk on, and so the stance and stride of the lizard has changed a little. HAS SCIENCE GONE TOO FAR??<br><br>this is all adjustable though, so your guys opinion on the &quot;feel&quot; of new lizards stride vs the old could be really helpful! <br><br>to me the new lizards look much more agile, which could make them appear even more threatening (and thats a good thing of course!) maybe a mix of some low and some high? keep the slower lizards close to the ground and the faster ones with the more agile stance? wot u think

Stop me before we get there!<br><br><b>Update 293</b><br>Feet are in! And some more sophisticated tail animation.<br><br>This time around I decided I wanted to give the lizard breeds more characteristic walks. They are all a tad slow at this point I think, that is a gameplay balance question that will be tweaked a lot later. Quite a lot of the stuff that&#039;s supposed to be in isn&#039;t yet - for example they are supposed to move with different efficiency when occupying different terrain (pink <i>can </i>climb on poles, but it&#039;s somewhat slow and clumsy) and when moving in different directions (green is considerably slower in any vertical movement that requires it to lift its heavy body). <br><br>Here&#039;s the pink lizard with legs. It&#039;s a bit boring and anonymous in my opinion - which it&#039;s partly supposed to be as pink is the default, but it could have something more going on, definitely. Remember that this is just movement through the terrain, so they still don&#039;t have much to work with to convey personality.<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141227124052im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2014/08/20/7Hz1.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br><br>Here&#039;s the green one. It&#039;s heavier, slower, and moving more unevenly. It also lifts its feet with each step, sometimes resting on its belly for a moment between steps. Green is also supposed to have a stiffer tail than the others, to give it a bit of an alligator feel contrary to the soft gecko bodies of most of them. Can you tell?<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141227124052im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2014/08/20/tLAYi.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br><br>Blue has a rapid, even, smooth movement where all four limbs are constantly working. You might also notice how it&#039;s able to grab on to walls, and how it is more agile and more inclined to climb. <br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141227124052im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2014/08/20/jFqZR.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br><br>So much fun! I was dying to get back to this kind of stuff :D The feet still have some weird flickering at times, and I&#039;m not sure how happy I am about when the legs overlap each other perfectly, so there is still tweaking to do. For fun, here&#039;s one of them moving together:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141227124052im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2014/08/20/i1q9.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>You might notice that the interactions still feel a little blocky and uneven. There are some getting stuck scenarios left, especially as the lizards are not aware of each other at this point. When two of them get in a deadlock pushing against each other they have no protocol for what to do in that situation. But you can see some interesting stuff too, such as how the green one is way heavier than the blue one and pushes it out of the way without any impact on its own movement. In the future I hope to create a really interesting dynamic between lizards, having them getting annoyed with each other and whatnot.

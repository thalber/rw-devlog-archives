I&#039;m kind of a purist when it comes to what is canon in the game. We have talked about having creating your own playable character as a reward - in that case there are two solutions I&#039;m willing to go with: <br><br>Either the parameters of customization are <i>extremely </i>limited, basically just color. <br><br>Or people are allowed to put sunglasses on their slugcats or whatever, but the content is purely cosmetic, and unlockable only through some kind of far fetched key combination or something, so other people won&#039;t have to hurt their eyes by seeing it. Or perhaps a text file with a code that unlocks that specific character. <br><br>In this latter case you won&#039;t strictly have <i>the whole game accessible to everyone</i>, but it doesn&#039;t matter that much because all of the content you&#039;re missing out on is purely cosmetic, ridiculous and off-canon. You&#039;re not missing out on official game content, you&#039;re missing out on some dude&#039;s desire to play as a slugcat with Johnny Bravo hair, and that&#039;s not such a big tragedy in my eyes. <br><br>When it comes to crossovers, my canon purism also applies, but some very subtle little references to other media is acceptable as easter eggs IMO. Like, finding a secret room with a little drawing on the wall that could be interpreted as a wink to some other game or something.

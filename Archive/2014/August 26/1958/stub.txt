If you dont use that coloration for all the lizards (i vote for that), then perhaps as a distinction for the larger &quot;adult&quot; versions of each breed.<br></div>Haha if you think so, we can keep it! But then I don&#039;t know about the little fin the blue one used to have, maybe we&#039;ll have to come up with something else there...<br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141227124052/http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.msg1054969#msg1054969">Quote from: Rojom on August 25, 2014, 06:01:04 PM</a></div><div class="quote">Those are so smooth...and terrifying. Loving the faint 3D effect when the tails change direction, even if unintentional. It&#039;s unbelievable how much you can do in a day.<br></div>Thanks! Yeah, I like that effect too - it&#039;s just a side effect of the tail triangles having been added root to tip - the brighter tip segments are rendered on top.<br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141227124052/http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.msg1054978#msg1054978">Quote from: Christian on August 25, 2014, 06:38:49 PM</a></div><div class="quote">Tails look amazingly fluid.

Because that would be terrifying to think you&#039;re safe, only for the scenery rustle and see the tails flick around and then disappear again <br></div>That exact scenario can hardly be recreated in our sidescroller view, but we could definitely have them hiding in vegetation at times, with only the tail spottable!<br><br><b>Update 297</b><br>Spent most of the work day on a train, which doesn&#039;t lend itself well to graphics work as I can&#039;t use the mouse - instead I did some re-structuring in the creature templates and other less exciting stuff. I also made a few changes to the lizards, moving all of their behavior to a new method call that&#039;s only called from the main update call if the creature is neither dead nor stunned - in those cases it&#039;ll just lie limp. Got the limbs&#039; deactivation behavior respond to that as well, making the whole creature relax when stunned.<br><br>When getting home I did get around to converting some sprite sheets though, and now I have most of the head graphics over in the Unity version. I&#039;ve managed to implement head rotation, but not really any other behavior - it&#039;s still just staring straight forward with a dead gaze. I will be able to animate what the jaw looks like when opened and closed etc, but having the creature actually do these things by itself is for when I&#039;m writing the AI.<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141227124052im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2014/08/26/ryhwD.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>The head consists of 5 sprites - the eyes, the head, the teeth in the upper jaw, the teeth in the lower jaw and the lower jaw itself. I&#039;m happy to see all of these align, one worry was that there would be little gaps between them at places. When the lizard bites a creature, that creature is supposed to be displayed below some of those sprites, and above others, to make it look like it&#039;s stuck between the jaws. I still haven&#039;t figured out how to make that happen technically. One idea is that each lizard could have its own sprite container (similar to a movie script in flash) between its jaws, where all the sprites of the bitten creature could be moved. But when to move them there? You don&#039;t want the jaws to snap shut and <i>then </i>have the lower jaw blink and disappear behind the bitten creature...

<b>Update 253</b><br>A reasonably good day! Got a placeholder path finding class down, called &quot;quick pathfinder&quot;. This one doesn&#039;t really have all the cool stuff as the final AI pathfinders will, but it has allowed me to test the concept. <br><br>The actual AI is going to use a persistent map and overlay path searches on top of each other continuously (more on this when we get around to it) while this class is just given a start position and a goal position on spawn, and then works with trying to find a path between those. For the real AI my sense of tidiness would never allow spawning an object like this each time I want a path just to throw it away later, and it isn&#039;t good at doing dynamic path finding with both the goal and start positions moving as it works. Rather I plan to have the game use this object to analyze <i>if </i>it&#039;s possible to get from one point of the map to another, which will come in handy for some things I have in mind for later.<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141223101630im_/http://giant.gfycat.com/LiveGloomyAmericanblackvulture.gif" alt="" width="600" height="450" border="0"><br>(trying a new image service here, hopefully the pic will stay up)<br><br>As you can see, this object too works over the course of several frames. The only thing it has accessible to other objects is a status integer, which can be 0(working), 1(path found) or -1(finished, didn&#039;t find a path) and a function that if applicable retrieves the path as an array of tile positions.<br><br>It can also work within a single frame, then it&#039;s just a matter of looping until the status isn&#039;t 0 any more. The next step is to be able to feed it a list of accessibility info (&quot;I can&#039;t climb on walls, please give me a path that doesn&#039;t require that&quot;).<br><br>Oh, and those jumpy things are the lizards! Albeit under construction... Intimidating though, aren&#039;t they!? <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141223101630im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/whome.gif" alt="Who, Me?" border="0"><br><br>

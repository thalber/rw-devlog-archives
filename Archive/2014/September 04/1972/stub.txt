&#50504;&#45397;! I&#039;m arrived in Seoul, and spending my time trying to sleep during the night and not sleep during the day, both of which are easier said than done. But I think I&#039;m getting there. I&#039;ve also been (sleep)walking around my new neighborhood, and checked out where there might be some starbucks or something that could be suitable to sit and work. Other events include realizing that any small bit of Korean I might have ever known is now gone, so getting food at a restaurant is a sort of culinary Russian Roulette. Actually every interaction is like a sort of Russian Roulette if the only two words you know are &quot;Yes&quot; and &quot;No&quot; and you&#039;re just trying to sprinkle them somewhat evenly throughout the conversation. My landlady seems somewhat annoyed with me, but as I have a very dim idea of what she&#039;s actually saying I don&#039;t know for sure. Tomorrow I hope to have an actual update for you guys!<br><br>@Lee, hm, OK, I think I get it now. But wouldn&#039;t this mechanic mainly be about smoothing the leg movement? Smooth leg movement is not really my main concern here, rather the opposite - if the legs are too smooth the lizard will just look like it&#039;s floating with the legs tapping along under it. Some unevenness to the grabbing cycles is not really a bad thing. Rather my main concern is to make the steps as <i>long </i>as possible, and considering that, wouldn&#039;t a steering system like this only allow for the steps to be shorter? Like, to get the longest possible steps I should only let go when the leg is positively too far behind, giving up a grip any earlier than that would just make the step shorter, right?

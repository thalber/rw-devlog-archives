<b>Update 256</b><br>This week there&#039;s some family stuff going on, so I&#039;m in a house with <i>other people</i>&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141219115754im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/crazy.gif" alt="Crazy" border="0">. This situation doesn&#039;t really lend itself to the super deep concentration I need for path finding stuff, so instead I think I&#039;m going to do some art. <br><br>Today I did some experimentation with Rain World &quot;plant life&quot;, or whatever you want to call it. Not at all sure if all of them will go in the game, but it&#039;s a lot of fun to play with different shapes and ideas.<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141219115754im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2014/06/16/TEIiJ.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141219115754im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2014/06/16/MIHU0.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141219115754im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2014/06/16/voZuL.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141219115754im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2014/06/16/NjIUB.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141219115754im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2014/06/16/CIzol.png" alt="" border="0">

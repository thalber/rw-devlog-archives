Thank you sir&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150101111825im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/gentleman.gif" alt="Gentleman" border="0"><br><br>Mini class works super well&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150101111825im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0"> <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150101111825im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/hand-thumbsup-r.gif" alt="Hand Thumbs Up Right" border="0"><br><br>Stupid question #4224:<br><br>Now both the players and the menu need to take input, so I want to create a FetchInput function where you pass a player number and get the current state of axes + button for that player&#039;s input.<br><br>Now, the problem is that I want to return both a Vector2 for axes, and a bool for the fire button. Do I have to create a separate text file with an InputData class only to be able to return these two variables in one go? That feels super cumbersome. Also I know that I could bake them together into a Vector3, but that&#039;s a hacky solution that I&#039;m not learning anything from - I want to be able to solve this problem no matter what the data types happen to be.<br><br>Is there some equivalent of<br><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code">public Vector2, bool fetchInput(int playerNum){ <br>return new Vector2(0f, 0f), false;<br>}</div>that I could use? One of my searches suggests returning a KeyValuePair, but that seems like a hack IMO...&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150101111825im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/huh.gif" alt="Huh?" border="0">

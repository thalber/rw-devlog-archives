<b>Update 314</b><br>The lizards now have three of their main behaviors more or less done - idling, hunting and fleeing. The one missing is fleeing from the rain - when they can do all those things they&#039;re &quot;feature complete&quot; in that they&#039;ll work as a game mechanic, though the particulars of the behaviors can of course always be improved. <br><br>The very first step towards making them flee away from rain is introducing the dens they&#039;ll flee into - so that&#039;s one thing I&#039;ve done today. It&#039;s a change that goes pretty deep in the most basic infra structure of the game (rooms, connections between rooms, how rooms are loaded. Basically the foundation of the game world) and it&#039;s been a long time coming. It wasn&#039;t as bad as I expected it to be though, just an hour or so later the game ran again with no problems. The worst part was having to dive back in the lingo level editor to fix some stuff (yuck!) but other than that the new build seemed to be able to handle the changes. Something&#039;s gonna pop up down the line though, I guarantee it :S<br><br>Other than that I&#039;ve actually worked a little on cosmetics as well. As the idle behavior is slowly but surely coming together, there are some animation details that need to go with it. I know this has been the devlog&#039;s most boring week ever, but here&#039;s at least something visual to look at:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229083427im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2014/09/25/5DUoq.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Sorry about the chubby tail and tail gradient, I know we decided that was going away but I haven&#039;t gotten around to changing it yet. What you&#039;re supposed to look at here is that the head can move, and that there&#039;s subtle movement in the tail and a hint of breath contractions around the chest area. If the lizard is dead or knocked out those movements should probably stop.

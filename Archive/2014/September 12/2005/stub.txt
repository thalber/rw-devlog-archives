<b>Update 306</b><br>Well, most of the day was spent in hesitation over above issues - I did some calculating back and forth but that obviously didn&#039;t help me much as I do realize that what I think of as &quot;big numbers&quot; or &quot;small numbers&quot; is irrelevant to the scope a computer. I didn&#039;t want to start implementing it without knowing it was going to be an actual realistic solution, so I kept away from it and did some other poking around today.<br><br>For example I made the dead end mapper use the creatures&#039; terrain preferences rather than a first-best grab of tiles, meaning that now the maps will hopefully gravitate a bit towards terrain that the creature is comfortable with.<br><br>Another thing I did which has been a long time coming was implementing a terrain proximity map in the common AI map:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141228135550im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2014/09/12/mqCre.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Any flying creature will be very thankful to have this info, as it allows it to know what&#039;s open air and what&#039;s uncomfortable tight spaces. Also, if we want to add a creature bigger than 1 tile wide, this allows that creature to know where it can move. <br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141228135550im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2014/09/12/Z4fpv.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Here&#039;s a dead end map for the fly with a preference to stay away from walls, looks pretty reasonable for a fleeing behavior for a flying creature right? Given that those bottom two corridors are room exits, otherwise it shouldn&#039;t have anything to do down there.

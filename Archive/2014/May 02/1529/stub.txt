Each layer can have multiple textures, just render them as quads (this way your levels can be as big as you want). Then draw the layers again with a custom &quot;depth color&quot; instead of rgb in a low-bit-per-pixel screen sized render target. Now you can do some depth effects with the information from the &quot;depth texture&quot; and the &quot;color texture&quot;. <br><br>If you run short of memory maybe you can use one texture for multiple textures by using each color channel for one texture.<br></div>This sounds super nice! And I don&#039;t quite understand what you mean - how does rendering as quads solve the problem with the texture being too big?<br><br>Dancing dead - Yeah I totally know how you traditionally do parallax scrolling, and that was my original plan! But when I ran into this hurdle I started thinking about the ray tracing shaders such as parallax mapping as another way to solve it, without actually storing all that data, but rather working from something like just a texture and a depth map. The parallax scrolling here isn&#039;t really distinct objects with large distances between them, but rather one single box might consist of 10 layers very close to each other, making it more of a voxel solution. So I though maybe I could fake that effect without doing parallax proper. Like, just bending the edges of stuff a little to fake some shift in angle, like this:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150108074812im_/http://cdn2.list25.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/011.gif" alt="" border="0">

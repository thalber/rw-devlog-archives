For example, when a green lizard walks up to a tunnel, the entrance and exit arrows slowly turn green, while for the player they would turn white. I assume in multiplayer slugcats will have different colors, so that might fix that issue.<br><br>I also think it would be nice if the arrows aren&#039;t (extremely) visible when you&#039;re not close to an entrance. That way you really have to be close to a tunnel in order to &#039;discover&#039; it.<br><br>Just throwing in some thoughts&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20191128021134im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/derr.gif" alt="Durr...?" border="0"><br></div>The color idea is really interesting!

As the slug cat gets closer, maybe some blowing weeds, plants, wires or water drips...? I don&#039;t know I&#039;m just rambling now.<br><br>I kinda preferred it when it wasn&#039;t obscured, you just saw the tunnel and the slug cat / lizard climbing through it. Also what happens if a lizard comes the other way while you&#039;re in the tunnel?<br></div><br>What do you mean &quot;when it wasn&#039;t obscured&quot;, do you mean the shortcuts or do you just mean like, an ordinary tunnel made from level geometry?

I don&#039;t know if you guys remember my post about how I think of in-world coherency from a few pages back? Basically the shortcuts are already a huge, weird exception from how the physical reality of rain world otherwise works, and as such I think it&#039;s way less awkward to embrace them as exceptions rather than try to shoe-horn them into some kind of more realistic representation.<br><br>For those of you who suggested more muted arrows, I tried toning down the color a bit and going back to the smaller size of the lingo build:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20191128021134im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2014/10/31/xAfMu.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>This is the size and color they were when I stood on the PAX floor and put my finger to them saying to people &quot;THERE IT IS DO YOU SEE THE ARROW&quot; and people were like &quot;NO I DON&#039;T SEE A THING&quot;, buuuut, I think that the expo floor was probably a pretty stressful context, where most people were playing the game for just a couple of minutes while standing up. Playing the game at home, sitting closer to the screen, people are probably able to pick up more subtle visual cues. What do you think, is it better?<br><br>Those of you that want to indicators at all - I totally get your point. Aesthetically they <i>are </i>a bit of clutter that we&#039;d perhaps be happier without. But, the end product here is a game, not a bunch of gifs, so playability trumps aesthetics if all else equal. What the game looks like will appeal to you for a few minutes, but what it plays like is what&#039;s going to keep you for several hours, so I&#039;ll have to go with that. Then of course, if we can have both that&#039;s obviously the best alternative <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20191128021134im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0">

I&#039;m not sold on the idea of having only the blinking arrows, because it&#039;s not in all scenarios where it&#039;s only the player alone triggering those things. Multiplayer can have 4 slugcats running around, and then you can&#039;t just look for where it&#039;s blinking. But I totally agree with you on it being too saturated and bright, it does look a bit too much like neon lights. Maybe if the wave motion stays, but is toned down some? That would make it <i>more </i>about the blinking arrows, but there&#039;d still be some motion to follow in order to get to the right arrow.<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20191128021134im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2014/10/31/592d3.gif" alt="" border="0">

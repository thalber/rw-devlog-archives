There isn&#039;t really anything such as a solid &quot;no win state&quot;, because the game engine is too floaty and unpredictable for something like that to be 100% decided. Something weird can always happen, where you&#039;re just <i>sliiiightly </i>out of the correct biting angle for the lizard or something like that. But a situation can definitely be really, really bad, such as this, hahaha!

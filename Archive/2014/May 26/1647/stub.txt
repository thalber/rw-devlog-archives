Ohhhhh.... RÃ¦tikon is sooo beautiful o.0<br>Actually I don&#039;t think I could give up control of the art under gunpoint, but thanks for the offer! I&#039;m certainly open to tips and tutoring though, especially when it comes to readability etc. At the moment I&#039;m in full Unity catch up mode though, so it might be a while before I return to art stuff&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141227124050im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0"> Oh, and it&#039;s mostly James who checks that email, if you guys want to actually talk to me I recommend my email which is linked from my profile here.<br><br><b>Update 142</b><br>Ported some of the &quot;using the arms to balance&quot;-code, and found myself laughing at this. If you view it as a <i>dramatic gesture</i><br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141227124050im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2014/05/26/Epbqx.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Ta-Taa!<br><br>Also note how the tail is used for balance, and there&#039;s a bit of a tilt to the body. Most of that tilt is actually not reflected in the physics, it&#039;s just the graphics module doing some decoration work. I feel like I want the actual physics engine to be solid, and not have too much weird flickery random numbers and sine curves in it or it might become unpredictable.<br><br>We&#039;ll see if this still looks funny when the actual arm graphics are in, if so I might have to do something about the maths behind it.

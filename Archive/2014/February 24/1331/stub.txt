Hm, wow... Is that an issue to the degree where it might be worth it to in some cases (thinking particle system) save instances of objects in some kind of vacancy list and bring them in later, rather than deleting/respawning them?<br><br>Gentlemen, here&#039;s a programming question for you:<br><br>If I have to sort an unknown amount of some object by some property, how is that done?<br>Say that I have a projectile travelling through the air. I&#039;ve made a line from the object&#039;s last position to its current position, and checked that line towards the objects in my game. It shows that the line intersects objects A, B and C.<br><br>What I want to do now, is to sort the objects by their distance to the projectile&#039;s <i>last </i>position. The object that&#039;s closest to where the projectile was last frame was hit first, and it&#039;s to this position I want to move the projectile, and it&#039;s this object I want to be affected by it.<br><br>In lingo, I&#039;d do it like this:<br><br><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code">distanceList = &#91;]<br><br>distanceList.add( [distance(projectile.lastPos, A.pos), object reference to A] )<br>distanceList.add( [distance(projectile.lastPos, B.pos), object reference to B] )<br>distanceList.add( [distance(projectile.lastPos, C.pos), object reference to C] )<br><br>distanceList.sort()<br><br>myHitObject = distanceList[1][2]<br>hitObjectDist = distanceList[1][1]<br></div><br>Basically a 2D array, and when asked to sort it would sort by the first position in the sub-array. <br><br>In C# though, I have to define what data type the slots in an array is, and making a 2D array seems much more bothersome. Does anyone have any good tips on how to do this? I&#039;d be super happy for some kind of general solution, where you can sort anything by anything. Like, &quot;which player out of these 4 have the most points&quot; etc.<br><br>Thank you <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150102024711im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/grin.gif" alt="Grin" border="0"><br><br>Edit: Oh yeah, maybe I should be clearer - I know there is an &quot;orderBy&quot; keyword, which I will definitely look in to, but in this case I want to <i>keep</i> the property I&#039;m sorting by. When doing orderBy it seems the property you order by dissapears after the sorting is done, and also it seems you have to calculate it again, you can&#039;t throw in a value you already have. This means that in the above case, if I use OrderBy, I&#039;ll have to calculate distance no less than three times - first when repeating through the objects and checking if I want to add the object to the list, then again when sorting, and then a third time when I actually retrieve the closest object and start doing stuff to it. In my Lingo solution, I could calculate it just once, throw it in the list, sort the list by it, and then grab it again after sorting.<br><br>Edit edit: I could create a custom class, that has only an object reference and a value to sort by, and fill the list with those. But that seems garbage collection heavy, right?

<b>Update 292</b><br>Finally I&#039;ve gotten to work on the lizard cosmetics!<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141227124052im_/http://oi59.tinypic.com/f0nel2.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br><br>There is some kind of tail now!<br><br>James and I have also been having a few talks today. One of them was about was about individual variation on creatures. We both like the idea that each creature should have slight individual deviances, probably from a random seed, to make them look less like clones. <br><br>The problem as I see it is this - we have the breeds of lizards. The idea is that the player should be able to learn the behavior of each breed. &quot;Greens are slow and dumb&quot; for example, or &quot;Blues can&#039;t take much abuse, but can climb walls&quot;. What I worry about is two scenarios. One is that individual differences drowns the breed traits, so that everything becomes a random sludge. The other is that in order to not end up in the random sludge, we will need to make the individual traits so very small that they are actually not significant in any way, and then the effort was in vain.<br><br>One solution is to have the differences be purely cosmetic. Short tail, long tail, that sort of stuff. This is safe, so I think we might do this kind of stuff regardless.<br><br>Another is to have somewhat rare, but very <b>clear </b>unique individuals that appear late in the game when you&#039;ve already come to know the categories. That would be stuff like &quot;It is very clearly a blue lizard in every part of its behavior, but it&#039;s large as a green lizard&quot;. The kind of stuff that can be easily understood by an experienced player. This solution would probably take on a bit of a flavor of &quot;bosses&quot;, as these deviant individuals are likely going to be mostly harder than regulars, and the element of unfamiliarity and surprise will play in their favor either way.<br><br>The jury is still out on this one, and luckily the jury probably have quite a lot of time to think about it before it&#039;s time for an implementation. But it&#039;s never a bad thing to plan ahead! <br><br>What do you guys think?

spot on! youve intuited a bit of what were going to be going for as far as implied / unforced narrative stuff. <br><br>its an interesting scenario, because exactly as you say there is a built-in game mechanic that is fairly simple (and fun!), yet has a large amount of possibilities as to how things could potentially play out within the open world were trying to create. we dont want to limit a persons play options to one narrative path just for the sake of &quot;Telling A Story&quot; because you would feel that artificiality, like bumping up against a glass wall: &quot;I want to go here, but a big blinking arrow is telling me to go there.&quot; That sort of thing we really want to avoid. So it&#039;ll be a matter of baking the potential for scenarios into the structure of world itself and letting the player find their way through that (if they like) by whatever means they can.<br><br>We don&#039;t want to get too much into specifics (in fact were being pretty secretive about it), because a lot of the fun will be discovering how this happens. Very good question though!

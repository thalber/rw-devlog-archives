Thanks! I&#039;m glad someone isn&#039;t dying from boredom haha!<br><br><b>Update 260</b><br>Pretty nice progress! The lizard path finding algorithm seems to be basically working! It&#039;s only implemented for a weird flying lizard with no gravity and like 50% air friction, none of the lizard moves (reaching across a gap, dropping from a ledge, turning around) are implemented, the path finding can fire once only and then the game has to be reset, etc etc etc. But it seems like the very basic functionality of saving the path finding matrix as a 3D array and having the third dimension represent direction is down. I&#039;ve been able to place the lizard in a corridor and ask it to path to <i>behind </i>it, the path finder passed the lizard without it moving, made its way to a point where it could turn or move around something, got back to the lizard, and the lizard started to move. It&#039;s able to follow the paths pretty decently, though there is some getting stuck going on.<br><br>When the lizard path finding is done, every other path finding is going to feel easy in comparison. The lizard path finding is complex on a level where I can really feel the limitations of my mind, I simply don&#039;t have enough working memory to hold an entire situation in my head at the same time. When it gets to that I have two standard solutions. One is to not think but just mess around at random, which never gets me anywhere. After an hour or two of that I resort to the other one, which is bringing out pen and paper and thinking REALLY HARD. It&#039;s a weird feeling out there on the edge of one&#039;s cognitive ability - you&#039;d imagine that sitting on a chair and thinking couldn&#039;t be very exhausting, but it&#039;s actually super unpleasant, like working out without having eaten enough beforehand. I have a bunch of coins on my table which I find myself stacking and unstacking over and over instead of focusing on what I&#039;m supposed to.<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141219115758im_/http://oi61.tinypic.com/mbipg5.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br><br>The trick to this stuff was that it needed to have slightly different validity checks for paths when creating them and when following them, which probably has to do with the fact that the paths are calculated backwards. If I create the scenarios on paper as above and run them backwards and forwards I can see the problems and correct them, but I&#039;m unable to really comprehend and summarize what&#039;s happening, which is frustrating. <br><br>Despite being a bit unexciting, this week has been very productive! If the rest of the path finding stuff isn&#039;t significantly worse, we&#039;re better off than I&#039;d thought.<br><br>Have a nice weekend!&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141219115758im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0">

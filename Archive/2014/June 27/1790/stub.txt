now i wouldnt say that we are thinking specifically of discovery as one of the main attractions of the game, but as one way the game *might* be played. there wont be much in the way of blinking arrows forcing you to search through this or that region, so potentially a person could &quot;successfully play the game&quot; a number of times in a number of different ways without ever feeling the need to explore certain regions (or likely even being aware of some of these regions existence!) thats kind of the idea anyways: a large complex world where &quot;the narrative of this slugcat&quot; is just one meandering part. choices will also play an important role, so its even possible that going one direction might make going another direction impossible (or at least very very difficult), one potential action vs another action, that sort of decision tree stuff. these may be pretty subtle too.<br><br>this touches a bit on replayability, and again i really dont even want to even allude to too much here because holy cow spoilers, but the idea we are working from in that regard is that aspects of the meta-world and game mechanics might evolve depending on how the player chooses to play the game, so perhaps on the second play-through the world might be ready for your bag of tricks. were thinking of replayability as fairly central aspect, and even having it being tied into the mechanics of the multiplayer.<br><br>but this is all quite a bit far off though! as you mentioned before, were still in the nuts and bolts for quite a while yet&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141219115758im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/droop.gif" alt="Droop" border="0">

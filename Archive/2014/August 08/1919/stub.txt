I think so! Also I&#039;ve noticed that the search behavior doesn&#039;t change much from 2 ghosts and up, so I think 3 or 4 ghosts would be just fine. Also, for creatures that the tracking creature doesn&#039;t have much interest in (neither prey nor threat) tracking just 1 ghost or none at all will save some space, if that becomes an issue.<br><br><b>Update 285</b><br>Made the ghosts work between different rooms.<br><br>Created a system which gives ghosts a &quot;second chance&quot; before dismissing them on visual contact - this second chance consists of scurrying away very quickly hoping to find an obscured tile. This comes in handy when a ghost is sitting for example next to a short cut entrance, in that case it makes more sense to just move the ghost in through the shortcut when it&#039;s seen, rather than remove it. Its score is however downgraded, so the hypothesis of that particular ghost is considered less likely.<br><br>When I had this &quot;second chance&quot; system in place, I decided to have that apply to the last existing ghost <i>always</i>, and never delete it. This means that the tracking creature will always have some theory about where the tracked creature might be, though the hypothesis is considered more and more unlikely.<br><br>By having the lizard follow the &quot;best guess&quot; ghost of the player, I managed to have it display some pretty cool search behavior.<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141225201523im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2014/08/08/Sx62o.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>The little pink number is the estimated chance of relocating the player - this will play a part in actual AI decisions later, such as when it&#039;s time to abandon a hunt. The chance is calculated using an average number between the amount of ticks since the player was last spotted and the lowest generation among the ghosts (times ten). This means it takes both pure time and how much effort it has actually put into looking for the player into account.<br><br>Inspired by the Utility Based AI stuff, I made this curve for evaluating that probability:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141225201523im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2014/08/08/Nfxt3.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Up until the intersection (45 in the image) it follows the red curve, after that the blue one. This means that during the very first seconds it will estimate the chance of re-locating the creature as pretty high, then it will start to drop quickly. Then the blue curve kicks in, which never actually reaches 0, just gets closer and closer to it.<br><br>The idea is that the Tracker will always be able to suggest some small chance of finding any given creature and a coordinate to start looking, even though the search is more or less futile. This way I can make sure that all the decisions are actually made in the decision making AI. If the Tracker could &quot;give up&quot; that would essentially mean that the Tracker made the decision to stop looking for that creature, which isn&#039;t its job.<br><br>Here&#039;s a gif of the lizard prototype trying to search for a player that has been removed from the map. The estimated probability goes down, but it could theoretically continue this search for ever and ever unless told otherwise. Note how the search is first focused to the nearby area to where the creature was last spotted, but later moves on to further away areas as all of those options are exhausted.<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141225201523im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2014/08/08/9qTsl.gif" alt="" border="0">

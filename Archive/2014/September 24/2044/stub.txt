I know, I will give you something to look at! I&#039;m just so caught up right now... Please be patient just a liiiiittle longer! Yeah, that idea crossed my mind as well! It would be super easy to implement.<br><br><b>Update 314</b><br>I&#039;ve entered some kind of turbo mode, and am working like crazy. That said, I find it difficult to describe what I&#039;ve been doing today in simple terms. Creating lizard behavior, and changing what needs to be changed in order to create lizard behavior, I guess is what&#039;s going on. Today the lizards got a ton more going on for them. Mostly I&#039;ve worked on idle behaviors. When idle, they slow down some, stop a while, move between different spots. They sit and look at other objects - taking things such as how fast the objects are into account when deciding what to look at. They all have different preferences when it comes to choosing a spot to sit - green ones like an open floor, pink ones like to lurk in a narrow space, and blue ones prefer sticking to some wall high above everything else, ready to drop down on whatever might pass by.<br><br>I think what&#039;s going on here is that I&#039;ve suddenly found myself creating the game, rather than paving the road for creating the game. This process is a little different, as I can&#039;t be as brainy about it - it&#039;s not a bunch of tasks that can be crossed off, but rather a creative thing. That said, I <i>should </i>be able to devlog properly... So sorry about how this week has been so far haha! Tomorrow I promise to pull myself together and give you some gifs to look at!

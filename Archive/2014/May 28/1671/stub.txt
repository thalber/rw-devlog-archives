Yeah, hopefully we can find a use for it!<br><br><b>Update 144</b><br>Now I&#039;ve been doing fun visual stuff and spoiled you with gifs for a while, so today I returned to behind the scenery to do some tidying up. When trying to achieve something I generally tend to just write <i>whatever works</i>, and then I later need to go by it and clean the code. Also I&#039;ve been horrible at commenting for the last week or so, so that could use some work as well.<br><br>In behind-the-scenes news, I managed to have the application load the levels from outside the resources folder, and it was less of a nightmare than expected. I&#039;m using Unity&#039;s WWW class, which is actually used for downloading files from the web, but can be used locally on the disk as well. It&#039;s a dissynchronized load method, and I haven&#039;t really decided if that is cool or not yet. Worst case I can always just have the game wait and not do anything until the loading is done, and voila, I&#039;ll have a synchronized loading method. <br><br>Apart from that I&#039;ve started making little essential parts of the engine tick, that has been neglected till now. For example, movable camera:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141227124049im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2014/05/29/qErVb.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Looks fairly good even without the parallax, no? Of course I don&#039;t want the camera to behave like this in the actual game, I&#039;m leaning more and more towards the fixed screens as an artistic decision, but in order to have for example a screen shake effect this basic functionality needs to be in.

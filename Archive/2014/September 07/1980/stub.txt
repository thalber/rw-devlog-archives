A bit too perfect, perhaps. James is fond of it, and I can totally see its potential though, so maybe with a bit of tweaking! I don&#039;t know if you&#039;ve noticed, but the art restrictions I&#039;m keeping to is single color flat surfaces but with occasional gradients in the surfaces - never between two &quot;mundane&quot; colors (black, brown, whatever the level geometry is), but between a &quot;mundane&quot; color and an &quot;effect&quot; color (neon colors such as pink). So the gradient is technically within the restrictions, as are the colored feet. But I see your point - it does look a little bit different from the gradient in for example the plants, which is created with a mask. Let&#039;s see where it ends up! Right now I&#039;m just constructing all the pieces, there&#039;ll be plenty of re-adjusting and tuning later.

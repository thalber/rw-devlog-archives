<b>Update 364</b><br>Messing around with glitchy lizard behaviors. Introduced a few countermeasures against different getting stuck scenarios, and they do seem a little bit less prone to end up wiggling in some corner. Still a lot of those to hunt down though.<br><br>When I made levels, I&#039;d keep the lizard AI in the back of my head and adapt the layouts quite a lot to cater to lizards. James, who hasn&#039;t programmed the lizards, made a bunch of levels that were more free-form, and he naturally gravitated to adapting them for slugcat platforming rather than lizard movement. This meant that the lizards would oftentimes end up isolated in sub sections of the rooms, because the intended connection to get out of there was designed for slugcat jumping and not accessible to the lizards.<br><br>Yesterday we had a little talk about this issue, and decided to work on it from both ends. So James has been adapting the level layouts a bit, and I have been doing some additions to the lizards movement. Among those additions are a few new ways for lizards to move between tiles that are available to them. For example, earlier a lizard could stretch across from one tile it was allowed in to another, across a third empty but non-allowed tile. This was very blocky though, as it would only be allowed in perfectly vertical or horizontal cases. Today I added a connection that goes 2 tiles vertical and 1 tile horizontal, or vice versa (like the knight in chess). These kind of additions enable the lizards to traverse more different kinds of terrain, and opens up the maps to them. <br><br>With James&#039; level design adaptions and these changes, I think the lizards are going to become quite mobile throughout the world. However, we noticed that the isolated lizards had some benefits as well, as they gave us more control over lizard encounters. So now we&#039;ll try to find the perfect balance between penned-in and free roaming lizards.

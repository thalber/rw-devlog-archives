After digging in the lizard AI all day I decided to do something more fun, and implemented this hanging animation for the lower end of vertical poles:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170608092719im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2014/11/26/hbxa.gif" alt="" border="0"><br></div><br>oh man i love this so much hahah<br><br><b>SOME NOTES FROM THE LEVEL GEOMETRY SLAVE-PITS:</b><br><br>doing this first batch / region of rooms has been a really interesting process! in the previous build, the game was pretty simple structure-wise: gameplay was limited to 1 room at a time. those rooms are either platforming rooms or swarm rooms where you hunt bats. lizards were placed in a room and would stay there, sort of like a hazard, or they would be in swarm rooms to chase you around.<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170608092719im_/https://i.imgur.com/gcVhywNl.png" alt="" border="0"><br>(from lingo build)<br><br>but now the lizards (and everything else) can move freely between rooms, so choices have to be made in level design to either box them in to certain areas (to create &quot;an encounter&quot; scenario) or to just let them do their thing and run amok. there is definitely a discussion like&nbsp; &quot;whats the point of this open-world &quot;terrarium&quot; concept you&#039;ve been working on if you just box them in?&quot;, but probably for the first region at least we want to have SOME semblance of a difficulty gradient! we have a bit of a halfway mark in this first region because the species of lizards you encounter there have somewhat limited movement compared to the ones encountered later on, some of which can climb on structures that arent even accessible to the slugcat, etc.<br><br>But still its pretty funny because if you change ONE tiny thing in a room geometry (extend a pole here, or switch the order of room exits, etc), suddenly lizards over-run a whole new territory that you hadn&#039;t predicted:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170608092719im_/https://i.imgur.com/ADYtabPl.png" alt="" border="0"><br>(new build 141125)<br><br>So you have to make a tiny little change, then play through the build a few times to get a sense of how they are reacting to that change, then repeat. over and over. lizard herding! they are stubborn and temperamental just like cats! if you build them some nice room to play in, instead they go climb your drapes, hahaha!

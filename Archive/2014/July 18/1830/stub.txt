Thank you :D <br><br><b>Update 275</b><br>Similarly to how the human brain has its inner part, the reptile brain, and the surrounding cortex, the idea is that the rain world creatures will also have two levels of intelligence where the more complex works as an addon to the constant more static part. In rain world it&#039;s not going to be human level and reptile level though, rather like... Reptile and aemoba... Anyhow, the idea is that in the simple, abstracted world the creatures will make simple, abstracted decisions. When the environment is realized at tile level, the AI should get a more powerful component as well, to match it.<br><br>Today I&#039;ve been having a bit of a conundrum. Here are the options I&#039;m choosing between:<br><br>A - reptile brain keeps control always, and when the reptile brain decides on something (&quot;let&#039;s hunt!&quot;) that command is passed down to the complex brain, which refines it into more complex behavior (&quot;i&#039;ll go to this and that particular tile, etc etc&quot;). This is cool because it makes the creatures behave generally the same regardless of if they&#039;re abstracted or realized, which gives them truer autonomy. <br><br>B - reptile brain controls the creature when abstracted, but when the creature is realized the complex brain takes the wheel completely. It still uses the simple brain for storing destinations etc, meaning that if the creature is suddenly abstracted those essentials will remain for simple brain to use, but while the complex brain is running the simple brain is not allowed to execute any behavior. This is cool because it&#039;s cleaner - two different solutions instead of one gooed together, and because it means that the complex brain isn&#039;t held back by the simple one as it can do its own thing without relating to the abstract behaviors. <br><br>Hmmmmm... I&#039;m really unsure about this one actually! Which one seems the cleanest and easiest to work with to you guys?

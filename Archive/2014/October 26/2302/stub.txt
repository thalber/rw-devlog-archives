Thanks! No, that&#039;s not the problem any more - now the build builds, but the problem is that the shaders are all white. Even if I replace their content with the code from the one shader that is working (level coloration). If I give the sprite a color, the sprite will have that color instead of whatever color the shader tells it to have. So things kind of seem like that the problem isn&#039;t that the shader isn&#039;t working, but that the shader isn&#039;t there. What I&#039;m currently thinking is that the problem is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141215131928/http://answers.unity3d.com/questions/222523/shader-not-working-in-web-player.html" target="_blank">this </a>- ie that the shader is not included in the build because unity doesn&#039;t find a material using it.<br><br>Do you know of any way to force Unity to include some element in the build?<br><br>&nbsp;<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141215131928im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/gentleman.gif" alt="Gentleman" border="0"><br><br><br>Edit: Nah, that probably wasn&#039;t it as everything in a resources folder SHOULD be included. Now I&#039;ve isolated the problem to the following: Whichever shader has the name &quot;Additive&quot; works, regardless of content. No other shader works.

Working shaders! I wish I could describe what I did to help people in the future, but it pretty much comes down to Fiddling Around. By accessing the shaders from another place they ... idk, probably that Unity noticed the reference to them. So now it works! Also, under project settings -&gt; graphics you CAN actually create a list of forcefully included shaders. This wasn&#039;t the solution for me, but it might be for someone else. I think I&#039;ll put my shaders there in either case, because the game can&#039;t play without them either way.

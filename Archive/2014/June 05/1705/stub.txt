yeah basically! a large room or space can now be comprised of several screens which seamlessly transition. we want to preserve the rain world &quot;bunch of connected rooms&quot; feeling, but not be limited by it. <br><br>previously, it was a bit hard to show much of world geography or scale, as you&#039;d just pop from one single-screen-room to another single-screen-room, NES zelda style. we wanted a better way to show distance and preserve a sense of the shape of the large objects (rooms, buildings, whatever) you are exploring, but without resorting to the platformer style scrolling screen, which was not an option for a number of reasons.<br><br>so this works as a happy medium. it vastly expands whats possible for level design (and the mood we can convey with it), but also preserves the rain world vibe. we&#039;ll have to keep an eye out to making sure we don&#039;t start doing too many platformery things just because we can though, so call us out for that if you see it. we want it as a tool, not &quot;a genre&quot;, if that makes sense.

whoa thats a really good question, and its something we&#039;re probably going to be exploring the next half a year or so. this devlog generally tends to be more about the technical side, letting the more artsy / conceptual aspects sort of speak for themselves, but answering this requires a bit of a journey into that bog. (which im more than happy to oblige, as this bog is my home these days!)<br><br>from my perspective, rain world is sort of an elaboration on a few themes: ecosystems / scarcity / exploration / loneliness / choices / decay. the experience is interesting because joar has been able to stay very true to this kind of unique, brutal and impersonal world-view in what you&#039;ve seen so far. i think the underlying idea is that its more intended as a diorama or terrarium ecosystem than as &quot;a game&quot;, (yet is still hopefully playable and fun as a game!)<br><br>so the challenge is in taking it from the snapshots of this central concept (as suggested by the alpha) and into a full game that is cohesive, with a sense of progression, fully realized world, etc., and not resorting to &quot;bad guy lizard stole your girl/boyfriend, go get them back&quot; sort of thing which wouldn&#039;t be true to the central concept.<br><br>So to steer this around to answering your question, its almost as if we have to build the world first before designing an area. how much of that world is actually shown is debatable, but the intention is to have the narrative/experience be a result of the game world, and thus the game mechanics. so ideally its sort of like this: <br><br>central concept -&gt; game mechanics implied by concept -&gt; world implied by concept/mechanics -&gt; areas and creatures implied by world / mechanics -&gt; situations and scenarios implied by creatures/areas/world/mechanics<br><br>if that makes any sense. but obviously we&#039;ve been discussing, debating and internalizing these concepts for years as RW has developed, so its not like we consult a flow chart or anything. Anyway, I hope that wasn&#039;t too much of a diversion and answered some of your question!

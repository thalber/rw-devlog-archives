<b>Update 250</b><br>Some slick functionality is finally settling into place! This is the state of things: A room can be however big or small it wants to, it&#039;s not capped by the screen size. Instead, if a room is larger than the screen, you can place several cameras (all of which together should cover the entire level) and the level editor will render a texture for each such view. The game will then switch between them as you move through the room, making sure you&#039;re always visible.<br><br>To me this is &quot;one room can have many cameras&quot; but I think that to someone that isn&#039;t as engrossed in the technical details as I am it would be &quot;now you can move between rooms by walking out the edge of the screen as well, not only through short cuts&quot;.<br><br>This whole system is coming together pretty well! I managed to make a 4-screen tower, and climb it with the game switching between the camera positions automatically in a way where I could always see myself on the screen. Because the loading of level textures is unsynchronized there&#039;s no hickup what so ever (on my computer) when passing from one screen to another, and you can actually jump on one screen and grab a pole on another without your timing being messed up by the screen change. You will become a little disoriented though, so I&#039;m going to have to make the placement of the screens clever - for example not have them change in the middle of a jump, heh.<br><br>I did come up with one little disorientation reducing mechanic I&#039;m very happy with though. When you get close to where the camera will snap to the next position, the camera shifts slightly towards that edge (the textures are slightly larger than the screen, so there is room for a few pixels of camera movement and camera shaking). This means that you&#039;re always warned ahead when the game is going to change the screen position, you&#039;re never just trotting along and getting completely shocked by a hard cut to another scene. Also, you are given a hint as to what direction the shift is going to be in, which will help you find your character after the scene shift. <br><br>When the game senses that you are getting close to an edge of the screen that is open to another screen, it will actually start to pre-load the texture of that next camera position. This needs a little work, for example it doesn&#039;t offload the texture when you change your mind and walk in the other direction, and I&#039;m unsure of how healthy it is for the RAM to have the texture hanging out in the background as the game is running. Also the preloading should apply when moving through shortcuts, which I haven&#039;t gotten around to yet.<br><br>Screens can also overlap, which is in a way a bit more confusing because it defies the age-old game logic of exiting one screen to the right and entering the next from the left. But it also provides more sense of space as you&#039;re able to see a few of the objects in the room from both vantage points, making you able to piece the room together as a whole in your mind. The use of this will certainly need to be balanced.<br><br>When playing in wide screen, the camera positions will work exactly the same, the only difference being that you get to see some extra pixels on each side of the screen. This means that in wide screen the overlap between screens will be even bigger. I need to do some fiddling with the shader before I get wide screen to work, but once there I&#039;ll be able to get a feel for how this whole system works with different screen sizes, and hopefully balance everything accordingly.

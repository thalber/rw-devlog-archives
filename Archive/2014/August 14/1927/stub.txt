<b>Update 289</b><br>Lizard movement is now basically working as I intended it to. Dropping from ledges, grabbing, and all that stuff is in and reasonably cool looking for pink boxes. <br><br>Other than that efforts have been somewhat unfocused today - I&#039;ve started many things and finished few. Flipping back and forth has been sorted by having the lizard have a counter set to something like 2 seconds when flipping, and during that time the path finder will assign the flip move a last resort status. <br><br>The embryo of an engine that will understand when the creature has gotten stuck is started on but not more. The idea here is that when a creature gets stuck it will be able to understand where and possibly even why it got stuck, and then be able to actually do something else rather than just trying the same thing over and over. It&#039;s actually a little bit of learning, but it will basically boil down to &quot;not getting stuck as much&quot; rather than anything mind blowing. More on that when I actually get to it. <br><br>The last unfinished effort of the day was starting on the system for dividing the lizard into separate breeds. This took some thinking; where to put the division in the code? The current solution is that each lizard breed has its own Creature Template, all of which inherit from a parent Creature Template, and that they <i>also </i>own a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141225201541/http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/type-object.html" target="_blank">Type Object</a> containing some breed-specific parameters. We&#039;ll see how that works out!

Anyone second switching to gyfcat? I don&#039;t think they can be embedded, so I&#039;m afraid the devlog might look a bit boring if all the animations are hidden behind links... Maybe for the bigger ones?<br><br><b>Update 355</b><br>Painstakingly re-added effect colors to the Unity Build! This took me on an epic journey through the two things that are my cryptonite - Adobe Director and Shaders. But it worked out in the end!<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141212163741im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2014/11/14/nhdV4.png" alt="" border="0"><br>(that little red stuff along the edge of the wall... No idea what that is! Have to hunt it down.)<br><br>Each effect color is actually no less than eight colors:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141212163741im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2014/11/14/guskO.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>The upper four pixels of one of these segments are: The color when it&#039;s close, and lit. Then close, and shadowed. Below that, distant and lit, distant and shadowed. Under each such block is the same thing repeated, but for the dark palette when the rain is getting closer. Here the left and right columns are the same, because there shouldn&#039;t be any light around anyways.<br><br>For the distance factor, the shader simply lerps between the colors depending on the depth of the specific pixel, making the colors a bit more washed out if they are further off into the fog.<br><br>The difference between the first and the second color here is that the second one is glowing in the dark - its &quot;shadowed&quot; colors are the same as its lit colors. I&#039;m pretty happy to have that amount of control - it means there&#039;s a lot of potential to fine-tune the aesthetical experience.<br><br>The colors themselves are not tuned yet though, and very much subject to change, but the system is up and working!<br><br>Going into the level editor I also fixed a few things in the level save method - now it saves fly hives again. Another thing that made a comeback for the first time in the unity version is that the level recognizes &quot;back walls&quot;, ie terrain that is behind the &quot;play layer&quot; but close enough for wall climbers to crawl on. <br><br>Other changes include some polish of swimming controls. Now you can get into the &quot;wall slide&quot; position while in the water, which allows you to do a little wall jump. The lack of this feature had annoyed me for a while. There was also a weird glitch where you could exploit the water physics by rapidly tapping the jump button while swimming at the surface, the slugcat would somehow build up a wave and ride it, going faster and faster. I messed around with that a bit, adding a delay on the jump from the water surface, and balancing its forces a bit. While I was in the swimming code, I also added a potentially fun little feature - if you press the jump button while <i>under </i>water, you can get a little speed boost in exchange for a small amount of the air in your lungs. It isn&#039;t really worth it in most cases, at least not with my play style, but I always enjoy giving the player some extra options to make choices have even more depth. In some situation it might be just the thing.<br><br>Last for today, I got started on having the game recognize bat hives, grouping them properly etc. After that stuff is done, I hope to get to bat swarm behavior.

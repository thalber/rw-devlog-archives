I&#039;m using Unity, but the game logic itself is just c#, so it&#039;s still not impossible to detach it from unity if we wanted to. As of now, it doesn&#039;t look like there would be any reason to though <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231050607im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0"><br><br>Maybe the programming heavy stuff speaks to another (narrower) demographic - in either case our policy with this devlog has always been to just blurt out whatever is happening here, from graphic design on the logo to intricate technical issues, and that seems to have been working so far. As of now though, the game is largely designed already, and it&#039;s just a question of making it run in this new engine. So, for those of you who&#039;re interested in technical stuff, this is your time <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231050607im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0"> The rest will just have to bear with us for a moment. Soon I&#039;ll get into shaders, and then we&#039;ll have some posts of wizardry so profound that when we return to the ordinary coding stuff it&#039;ll look like a first grade reading assignment, if that&#039;s any comfort o.0

Hahaha OK I&#039;ll work faster!<br><br>Yep, that&#039;s the garbage worm level, it was at the top of the list&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231050607im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0"><br><br><b>Update 131</b><br>Managed to import a texture and display it as a Futile sprite, so that&#039;s cool! It&#039;s not super cool yet, the texture is super small for some unknown reason, and obviously I haven&#039;t written any cool shader or anything yet, so it just sits there at the side of the level. But I&#039;ve managed to work with the basic logistic of getting the thing into the game, so that&#039;s cool!<br><br>For all of you out there who are fumbling in the dark for advice on how to do stuff in Futile, here&#039;s my (probably temporary) solution:<br><br><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code"><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>//Roomtexture is just a string that&#039;s the name of the file we last loaded as a terrain graphic. <br><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>//If we have a graphic loaded, we unload it<br><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>if (roomTexture != &quot;&quot;)<br><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Futile.atlasManager.UnloadImage (roomTexture);<br><br><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>//The graphics are located in ..\Assets\Futile\Resources\Levels, and Futile starts looking for <br><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>//imports in Resources, so we start our path there.

And some shader stuff, perhaps. Wish me luck.

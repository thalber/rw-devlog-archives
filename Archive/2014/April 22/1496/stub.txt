<b>Update 226</b><br>And so I&#039;m finally back at it! Started working on the engine for short cuts. This is a core element of the game, the thing that enables a creature to crawl into a hole and then pop out of another hole, somewhere else on the level or on another level. Essentially it&#039;s going to be the same, except that this time around the game will not recognize a creature inside a short cut as being in any specific room. The creature will exist, but as floating in some kind of limbo between rooms, to be assigned a new room as the short cut spits it out. <br><br>This is meant to further de-emphasize the rooms as cardinal containers for events. If you can move between rooms as effortlessly, and with the same code, as you move within them, I hope that&#039;ll increase the impression of an interconnected world. Also, de-attaching a creature from any room while it&#039;s in a shortcut prohibits it from weird interactions with other objects while it&#039;s in shortcut mode.

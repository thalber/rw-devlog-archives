<b>PRETTY BIG NEWS:</b> the first region of the game world actually is up and running!&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141211122412im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/hand-metal-r.gif" alt="Hand Metal Right" border="0"><br><br>For the past few months I&#039;ve been planning out and constructing the first playable area of the game world, a somewhat self-contained 30-ish room &quot;suburban&quot; region. Joar and I have been calling it &quot;vanilla rain world&quot;, as its all about the vibe and scope of the original rain world game concept, before the game branches out and begins exploring interactions with new areas, mechanics, creatures, etc. <br><br>Anyway, the process to get it all rendered and connected and working with the new engine has been a bit tricky (to say nothing of the work actually constructing it!), requiring multiple updates to the level editor and tons of fiddling with fussy details in the individual rooms etc. But this morning after a new build and some time fiddling, it booted up smoothly and OMG IT FINALLY WORKS:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141211122412im_/https://i.imgur.com/skw4fyAl.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>See those colored squares at the top? That means the whole region, all 30 rooms, are up and running and interconnected and talking to each-other, just like they&#039;re supposed to. You can move fluidly from room to room and it all works without a hitch. It&#039;s one thing to know that *theoretically* it should work, and totally another to have the pieces come together and it actually happen. If I had ten bottles of champagne i&#039;d pop them all right now. <br><br>There is still quite a bit of polish to add, some of the rooms are still connecting a bit funky, but this is some solid progress. And now Im going to go get a meatball sub to celebrate!

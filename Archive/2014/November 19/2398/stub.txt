its probably been a while since we actually talked about the function of the rain huh? the rain is a perpetual cycle. &quot;Rain World&quot; and all that. basically you have X amount of time to go out into the world, gather food and return to your shelter and hibernate before the the rain strikes. if you dont gather enough food for that cycle, you starve. if you get caught in the rain, the above happens. if you get eaten by some other hungry creature... well thats obvious. but that is the basic game mechanics in a nutshell!<br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141211122412/http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.msg1084444#msg1084444">Quote from: Christian on November 19, 2014, 11:48:39 AM</a></div><div class="quote">Any chance we could get a video of the death rain?

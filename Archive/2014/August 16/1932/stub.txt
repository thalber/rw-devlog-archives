My question is, why? Is it because you&#039;re using Unity now? Or maybe that you realized that the Lingo version was inefficient? (I&#039;ve been wondering this for a while now, so I hope it&#039;s not confusing <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141225201541im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/tongue.gif" alt="Tongue" border="0">) <br></div>The reason why I&#039;m re-working a lot of the solutions is that in the old build, I never intended to have more content. Everything I added was &quot;the last thing before I&#039;m gonna ship this&quot;, meaning that I never did generally applicable solutions, only patch work and quick fixes for whatever I had in front of me at the time. In the end the bulk of the game ended up being band-aids on band-aids, meaning that the machinery <i>worked </i>alright, but whenever something was to be changed or added, it was a mess.<br><br>This time around, I&#039;m making generalized systems for everything, such as path finding. This means that down the line, if I want to for example add a creature, I can just plug in the path finder, and bam, it&#039;s up and running (after three hours of tweaking, so maybe not BAM, but way faster than building it from the ground up). If there is a bug in said path finder, it will have to be fixed in just <i>one </i>place, rather than one for each creature.<br><br>And when I&#039;m at it, of course I&#039;m taking the re-write as an opportunity to do some optimizations. I&#039;m not really &quot;using Unity&quot; from how I understand it, I&#039;m using it for rendering sprites and I use some of its C# library, but I&#039;m not doing anything in the Unity editor. However I am converting the game, from Lingo to C#, so while I can glance at the old code I in fact have to re-write everything. For the slugcat I did a straight port of the old movement behavior, but with the lizard I&#039;m not quite as thrilled about the old physics, so I&#039;m taking this opportunity to do some changes.<br><br>Edit: Oh, and a question for you seasoned programmers out there - I think I have an infinite loop somewhere in my code. Unity just freezes, and it&#039;s really hard to find what&#039;s causing it because each time I have to force exit with the task manager and restart everything. It&#039;s somewhere in the lizard code, because it only happens when there are lizards... Are there any ways to find infinite loops? Can you for example tell the monodevelop debugger to throw an exception if any loop has run more than 1000 times, so I can find where this thing is hiding?

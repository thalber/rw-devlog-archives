The controls are something we&#039;ll definitely want to spend some solid time on down the line, once we have a good sense of what will be needed. There will also be a bunch more &quot;slugcat moves&quot; as well, which will factor into all that. <br><br>But also I think its important to retain a degree of difficulty when navigating the environment. There should be a sense in the tactile experience of the game that life as a slugcat is *difficult*. Everything should be slightly to big for you to comfortably climb up, slightly too far to jump to without sufficient skill. Minor mistakes should potentially have consequences. You should constantly feel out of place, outnumbered and out gunned. And if you can&#039;t get up to a ledge comfortably, then perhaps you dont want to encounter whats beyond it yet! Then as you get used to the timings and rhythm, develop the more advanced tricks and techniques, then the world naturally begins to open up to you.<br><br>Buuuuut were not quite there yet <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141227094626im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0">

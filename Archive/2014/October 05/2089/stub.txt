Yeah definitely. The ones shown are the standard palettes, and in those I want to keep the shadows from being distracting - but when the game gets some more areas that are focused more on mood rather than action, there&#039;ll be palettes with much greater contrast between light and shadow, so you really can&#039;t miss it!

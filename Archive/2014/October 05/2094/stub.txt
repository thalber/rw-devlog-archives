What you&#039;re seeing is a dijkstra map being generated with a completely random next-tile-to-expand-heuristic, and as each new tile is added it traces back to the origin point and increments the values along the way, creating the tree-like structure.<br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150108070339/http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.msg1068769#msg1068769">Quote from: fizmat on October 05, 2014, 11:08:57 AM</a></div><div class="quote">I say 200kb per map is OK.

And even if it won&#039;t fit, nothing you can do about it.

Nicely done! I&#039;d love to see some more complex background shapes.<br>Unfortunately, for my own game, I can&#039;t afford going per-pixel like this. I tried to implement dynamic shadows today in the most efficient way I could think of, and yet it still fell flat on its face at ~30 fps. Guess I&#039;ll have to stick to static shadows. I&#039;ll give that earlier material a read, though.<br><br>Edit: oh, and thank you, of course, for replying!

If you do that stuff on the processor, it&#039;s just too slow.

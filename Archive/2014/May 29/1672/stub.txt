<b>Update 145</b><br>I slipped away from the boring tasks and did something useless but fun instead... Arm behavior in mid-air:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141227124049im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2014/05/29/jP0Qi.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>The weird jerky movement where the tail becomes square is when I do a hard reset of the player&#039;s position to the center of the screen, and of course there won&#039;t be anything like it in the actual game. <br><br>I tried to make the arms look a little bit like they tried to balance the body in the air, at the same time as they&#039;re ready to protect against impact with terrain. They also have a little bit of terrain awareness - every frame they look for terrain in a somewhat randomized position that&#039;s in front of the body. If it has terrain in it the arm will gravitate that way, hopefully looking like something along the lines of either trying to soften the impact of an incoming floor or clawing for a grip at a wall.

Hahaha OK let me calm you down by letting you know that in the gif the behavior was very exaggerated in order to show the functionality. Like James mentioned, the &quot;meteor jump&quot; is very signature to the slugcat, and I wouldn&#039;t want to give that up for some flailing. <br><br>The way it works is like this - every frame you&#039;re airborne, a value is incremented by the magnitude of your velocity vector. When you hit ground that value is reset. If that value is larger than a specific amount, this arm behavior starts to show. So, the longer you&#039;ve been in the air, and the faster you&#039;ve been moving during that time, the sooner the flailing will start. But the number is balanced so that a normal jump will never generate the flailing. <br><br>Here&#039;s an example of the normal lunge jump on ground, which is the same as always, compared to the lunge jump from a height, which will display a little arm movement:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141225201522im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2014/05/29/iA2l0.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Also note that in normal speed much of this is too quick to even see, which kind of makes me question why I&#039;ve spent an entire afternoon on it hehe!

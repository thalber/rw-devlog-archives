Yo! So I&#039;m meeting up with Joar in Seoul for the next few days, meaning that probably nothing at all is going to get done while I force him to play tour guide, hehe. No that&#039;s not true of course, one of the main reasons I&#039;m here is so he can teach me some of the more arcane ways of the level editor (tile, palette, lighting aspects, etc), plus we&#039;ll be planning out some more of the long-arc / business stuff. But in the interest of full disclosure, we&#039;ll mostly be eating samgyeopsal or kimbap while doing so&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141212172324im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/toast-l.gif" alt="Toast Left" border="0"><br><br>Talk to you guys in a few days!

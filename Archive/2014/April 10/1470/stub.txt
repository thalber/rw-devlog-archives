Hi there! <br><br>Just wanted say that I&#039;ve flown over to Boston, and we&#039;re going to be at PAX tomorrow! Also we have big news: we&#039;re going to be published by adult swim games! :D<br>We&#039;re going to appear in their booth during the convention, so feel free to come by and have a chat with us.<br><br>Preparing for this stuff has been the reason it&#039;s been quiet here for a while, we didn&#039;t want to announce anything before we knew for sure. But now everything is settled, I&#039;m trying to get my sleep cycle aligned to the american daylight cycle, and James is telling me epic tales of PAXes past. This is going to be a lot of fun! See you tomorrow <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231171149im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0">

<b>Update 308</b><br>There was a thing called Convert.ToBase64String which makes bit arrays into strings that are (from how I understand it) dense information-wise, and using that I finally managed to save my AI maps to the level files and load them again. These strings keep to ASCII characters and look a lot less menacing.<br><br>I have also created infra structure for checking that all levels are up to date upon starting the game, and if not doing the AI map calculation on them and saving the results to the level file. When the level is then loaded it&#039;ll unpack and use that info. This part took a bit of fiddling, as when the level is loaded <i>to </i>generate the AI map it shouldn&#039;t load the (non-existent or out-of-date) AI map, and when it&#039;s later loaded for real it should <i>wait </i>to apply the AI map, as it needs to generate some parameters from the level geometry before it can apply the AI data. <br><br>So yesterday&#039;s problems are solved! Instead a few others, more harmless ones have popped up. The dijkstra maps don&#039;t look perfect and probably need some messing with, and the thing that maps the distance between every exit and every other exit isn&#039;t plugged in and tried out yet. But the basics of pre-generated AI data is in! Yay!<br><br>In less happy news James told me that Gimym JIMBERT is apparently taking a pause from tigsource! D: This means that Project Rain World will have to do without its main developer for a while, I will however do my best to step up and fill the position myself. Thank you a million times for all the useful help, I wouldn&#039;t be half as far without it!

Yeah! These are actually far from perfect - if you look at the gif you might notice that there&#039;s some snapping going on at places. That&#039;s where one of the dijkstra maps approach the area from two different directions. Those tiles are considered far apart despite actually being close. The less dijkstra maps it has to work with and the closer they are the more stuff like that. But given the extreme benefits in speed and memory I think that&#039;s worth it by far. For AI&#039;s that are supposed to be a bit smarter you could maybe have a real dijkstra map being updated close to themselves or the threat they&#039;re avoiding, and then resort to the triangulation for the rest of the level. <br><br>Multidimensional diagonals worked out fine, the estimation looks a bit smoother. They&#039;re probably a bit slower as they have some exponents and a square root (it&#039;s actually just Pythagoras&#039;s theorem in n dimension) but that&#039;s still so vastly faster than creating actual dijkstra maps that it&#039;s not really anything to think about.<br><br>It will be interesting to see how the AI will be able to use this!

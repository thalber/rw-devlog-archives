Dijkstra map triangulation looking pretty good!<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229083422im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2014/09/17/X54nG.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>The color of each tile is how far that tile is estimated to be from the mouse pointer. It uses the largest distance it can find. <br><br>I have a bit of a heuristic approach here, where the it counts 1/3 of the straight line distance as one of the dimensions, meaning that straight line distance is accounted for, but not taken quite as seriously as the triangulation dimensions. This looks like a good balance to me, as if I didn&#039;t account for straight line distance at all it would display some pretty obvious weird artifacts and errors, but if I counted it in fully it would not leak through shortcuts at all.<br><br>Contrary to what I expected the algorithm does give some &quot;false far&quot; outcomes, in cases when all the exits are close to each other. This can be helped by giving the straight line distance more weight. I&#039;m thinking though, maybe I shouldn&#039;t actually just pick the largest value - instead I could try to calculate the multidimensional diagonal in triangulation space?&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229083422im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/evil.gif" alt="Evil" border="0"><br><br>It is pretty cool though! It gives an estimation of a dijkstra map between <i>any </i>two points that&#039;s decently accurate, and at 0 memory cost and 0 processing cost. The way to do this &quot;properly&quot; would be to move around a dijkstra map target every time it changes tile, do a complete flood fill, and save a huge grid of those values, just to throw it away on the next movement. Slow, weighty, and it couldn&#039;t really be done for more than a few moving entities. This system can estimate distances between all and any points on the fly! I do these calculations for every tile times every frame! With this system I could easily have 100 creatures asking for the distance to all 99 other creatures each frame, and it wouldn&#039;t even be a problem.<br><br>Gonna try my hands at those multi-dimensional diagonals now ...<br>

Yeah that was the original idea, but I think James have had some other thoughts since then. James?<br><br><b>Update 363</b><br>Another significant step - the room loader. This is the thing that loads rooms that are near to you and unloads rooms left behind. Right now it&#039;ll light up all neighbors to where you are (there is a limit, so not infinitely many rooms), and if too many rooms are active it&#039;ll start shutting them down. Then it goes by stuff like how long ago the room was viewed, and how many screen transitions ago.<br><br>Neighboring rooms that are activated and then <i>never </i>visited are unloaded on the next room transition. The system seems to run well! Performance wise it&#039;s smooth enough so far, and having all neighboring rooms loaded creates the nice effect that whatever room you&#039;re entering has been loaded a little while. Earlier the creatures would display a few frames of &quot;I&#039;ve just been loaded and will now try to act like I was here all along&quot;, but now when you first encounter them their animation states are already looking natural.<br><br>Other stuff of today&#039;s progress include:<br><br>* James requested being able to define some rooms and room connections as off-limits to bat migration, in order to be able to exercise a little more control over how bats move in the world. So I got some functionality for that in.<br><br>* The dripping water from the ceilings would be much more intense in small rooms, because it worked by picking a random ceiling tile every now and then and creating a water drip at it. Smaller ceiling, more concentrated dripping. I fixed this so the ceiling dripping appears a bit more even.<br><br>* You could wait at a shortcut entrance and eat an infinity of bats as they popped out of it. This obviously kind of broke the game. The hack I put in place is that bats now shoot out of shortcuts pretty fast, and have a few frames of &quot;uncatchability&quot; - the in canon idea being that they&#039;re swishing out of there too fast to catch or something. <br><br>* There was an error with effect colors (colors on plants, signs etc) where the last room&#039;s effect color would carry over when moving between rooms. Fixed that.<br><br>* Some minor animation quirks with the player character ~ there are more of those, but they&#039;re not really game breaking so they don&#039;t have the absolutely highest priority.<br><br>* Made the debug stuff (ugly map and ugly mouse cursor) hideable with a button. Long time coming, this one!<br><br>* Made it so that you can start the game in any room in the world, hopefully making level design a bit less painful for James as he won&#039;t have to actually walk all the way to the level he&#039;s working with in order to try it out.&nbsp; <br><br>So, that&#039;s one chunk of quirks down! The most scary stuff though, the lizard related glitches, I haven&#039;t gotten around to yet. Maybe tomorrow!

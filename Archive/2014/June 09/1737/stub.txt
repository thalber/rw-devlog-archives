seems like people are getting a bit wrapped up in the mechanics of the 3d implementation rather than what it would bring to the game (this game, rain world). ie. not much.<br><br>im sure everyone would agree that one of the most recognizable elements of rain world is the very unique art style, which is in some degree a direct result of the tools and methods being discussed right here. so changing all that, plus all the current tools assets and work, simply because there are other possible solutions to one very minor problem doesn&#039;t seem remotely reasonable. totally throwing the baby out with the bathwater. it would literally be making a completely other game.<br><br>has anyone ever said &quot;this game sure is great, specifically because of those half-second transitions between screens&quot;? i suppose its possible, but i certainly haven&#039;t said it. <br><br>anyway, i hope that doesn&#039;t sound too defensive. obviously all this feedback is super important (and please continue to do so!!), i just want to keep Joar from getting too bogged down defending technical choices made years ago that are now fundamental aspects of the game. cuz he&#039;s got a looooot of other work to do!&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141223101639im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/screamy.gif" alt="Screamy" border="0">

The first lizard in the trailer, I just can&#039;t tell if its one of the color variants for the pink lizards to match the foliage, or just a green lizard. Is there any chance the lizard appearance could change slightly for those of us with color blindness issues? Like crests on yellow lizards so they don&#039;t look so much like blue ones, or even a button in options to put a letter over their head representing that color.<br></div><br>this is a very good point and thank you for bringing that issue up! we will keep it in mind.<br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150105043040/http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.msg992553#msg992553">Quote from: RainWorldIsAwesome on February 06, 2014, 08:16:28 PM</a></div><div class="quote">Hey I&#039;d just like to mention how awesome this project is, not an original person but found out about it on kick starter and spent the last 12-14 hours reading the de log from the start. Pretty interesting I must say. Though I would have loved to have been a part of some of those discussions. So offering my support in anything you need, this project/hobby/ masterpiece is awesome and I can&#039;t contain myself <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150105043040im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0">. A question though in your kick starter you said that for one hundred twenty dollars you got your own creature, will that be in the final version of the game or just in those players games. Also if you could make more of that option I&#039;d gladly fund it.&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150105043040im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0"> and yeah end of rant. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150105043040im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/biglaff.gif" alt="Big Laff" border="0"><br></div><br>&quot;RainWorldISAwesome&quot; awwwwwww, thank you! <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150105043040im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/toast.gif" alt="Beer!" border="0"> responded in email, i liked your idea so maybe we can figure something out!<br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150105043040/http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.msg992590#msg992590">Quote from: Bandreus on February 07, 2014, 12:31:53 AM</a></div><div class="quote">Less than 1.8K $ to hit 200% funding.<br><br>YES WE CAN&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150105043040im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/hand-money-l.gif" alt="Hand Money Left" border="0"><br></div><br>YES!

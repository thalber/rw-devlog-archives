Thank you thank you thank you thank you! I&#039;m really pleased with how things are coming together as well <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141228144208im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0"> Keep in mind though that I hit record until it looks good - there are some ultra wonky or problematic recordings before I get a really good one, so there are still problems to sort out before the game looks good <i>every</i> time.<br><br>Jamming lizard mouths open - yeah, the idea has come up a few times, and I do like it. It&#039;s a really classic trope, putting a vertical stick in the mouth of some beast. But gameplay-wise I&#039;m not so sure ... like, if you have the spear, why wouldn&#039;t you just want to spear it? And if you could do both actions, how would the game know which one you wanted? I&#039;m not introducing a new button for that specifically, and it could get annoying if there was some context sensitive thing going on that didn&#039;t always line up with your intentions. We&#039;ll have to see if a natural way to implement it shows up.<br><br><b>Update 334</b><br>The goal I set out for today was making lizards carry their prey back to their dens, but that led to a million other things, so now I&#039;m just generally sorting out all sorts of stuff with that original goal in the back of my head. Mostly I&#039;ve been doing stuff that has to do with creatures carrying other creatures. Making it work with shortcuts was somewhat tricky, as well as having it happen between rooms, but those issues are sorted out now. <br><br>I&#039;ve started on a framework for creatures carrying other creatures in abstract space, which might be pretty cool. For example it means you might be able to enter a room and see a creature carrying another, or have a creature pass through your room with some prey already in its jaws, disinterested in you.<br><br>To me personally I think this is the most interesting aspect of Rain World - the &quot;terrarium&quot; or living world aspect. The player is a main character in the way that the simulation is run at a finer <i>granularity </i>close to where the player is, but the entire world will be alive and eventful all the time, if you are there or not. This is obviously going to be hard to make into a balanced game, but we&#039;ll try, haha. Dwarf Fortress has a similar philosophy and works pretty well because the game isn&#039;t about winning, but about the stories that develop through the unexpected interactions. We can&#039;t really fall back on that as much because Rain World is more of a traditional game that you play to win, but also we have astronomically fewer moving parts than DF. This is a balance issue we&#039;ll really have to give some close consideration though. Any way I&#039;m really excited that we&#039;re getting closer and closer to having the eco system simulation up and running. <br><br>One thing that hints that the dynamic food web is getting closer is a little test I did today. After having tested the lizard biting behavior exclusively on the slugcat, today I fired up a green and a blue lizard and told the green one that it finds the blue delicious.<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141228144208im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2014/10/08/URpa.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Everything connected flawlessly. The bodies connected, the blue lizard was not allowed to move, it was placed between the jaws of the green lizard, green can grab on to any of the body chunks and keeps its grip there, even the terrain impact bubble effects showed up to give the scene some extra flavor. I&#039;m really hoping this isn&#039;t becoming <i>too </i>brutal, I&#039;m not intentionally trying to make it dark and gritty, I&#039;m just implementing the mechanics and this is how it happens o___0<br><br>The point is this though; any creature can eat any creature - it&#039;s just one line of code in the relationship declarations away. In the old version something like this would have been a two day nightmare, if not impossible. It&#039;s going to be so much fun when we have more species running around!<br><br>Edit: This works equally as well apparently :D A bit over the top shaking for such a small prey perhaps ... <br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141228144208im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2014/10/08/Jpkc.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Note that I&#039;m not intending to have lizards hunt flies, I&#039;m just trying my &quot;anything can eat anything&quot; setup <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141228144208im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0">

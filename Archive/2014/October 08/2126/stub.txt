Could someone with some programming expertise help me out here? I&#039;m having some weird frame rate dips if I add a lot of lizards that have relationships to each other (smooth if they don&#039;t) and I want to know what&#039;s going on.<br><br>Unity&#039;s profiler says that 98% of the processor power was spent on &quot;RainWorldGame.Update&quot; which is about as helpful as a physician telling you that &quot;Yes you are sick&quot; -.- So I tried using Visual Studios profiler and attaching it to Unity, and everything was really complex in there so I got confused for a while. Then I noticed that the one thing eating all the processor power was something called mono.dll and after trying to research a little bit I kind of think that this is my entire game baked into a single file... Meaning I have the same problem again. I want to profile <i>inside </i>my solution.<br><br>Building the project as a stand alone and profiling that doesn&#039;t seem to work either - it still just refers to mono.dll. The function in mono.dll that&#039;s called a million times is actually mono.dll, does this mean I have a call stack problem? Some recursive stuff going out of hand? Or is it just that because all my game logic is recognized as mono.dll?<br><br>And Dear Visual Studio Wizard, when you are reading this, please also tell me why the VS debugger refuses to stop on exceptions? It does stop on break points!

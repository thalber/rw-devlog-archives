Thank you to everyone who&#039;s engaging themselves in this! It&#039;s very nice to see how concerned you all are about the success of our project :D<br><br>I&#039;m putting a little bit of a lid on the devlog for a few days, in order to build up for the kickstarter release (and because I won&#039;t be doing as much work on the actual game). Michael who&#039;s on board as a sort of kickstarter consultant (care to introduce yourself, Michael?) has been telling me that it&#039;s better to not leak out any stuff on the side while making the preparations for a kickstarter. You don&#039;t want to release any pressure before the big opening of the flood gates. So hold tight people, and be excited about the kickstarter launch! <br><br>Right now we don&#039;t exactly know what date we&#039;re going for, 9&#039;th is not entirely out of the question, but we could end up putting it a couple of days later as well.

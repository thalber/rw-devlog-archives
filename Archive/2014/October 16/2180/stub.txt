oh wow, i reallllllly like the squiggly wiggle walk the blue does right after it first hits the ground! is it just the physics of it reorienting itself after it frees itself from the tongue? i wonder if that could be how the blue just walks in general, it has such a perfect creepy snake-like flow too it. SO COOL.

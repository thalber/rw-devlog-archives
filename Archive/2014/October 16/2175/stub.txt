yep! that was in the lingo build even. were thinking of maybe taking it a bit further too and making them part of a (very) loose &quot;level progression&quot; mechanic thing, where perhaps spears are more of a scarce resource and you have to put some thought into how you use the ones you find: you find a spear. do you use it to try to get to new areas OR defend yourself against predators?

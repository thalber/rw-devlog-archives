Look at this guy trying to pass for not being a visual artist... That&#039;s some harmonious compositions right there!<br><br>@DarkWanderer, yeah, I could very easily put up a system that keeps track of &quot;annoyance&quot; with other creatures, and as accidental damage happens between them those numbers would be incremented. The tracker would be hooked up to the utility comparer, and when the annoyance with another creature got too bad it&#039;d flip to an aggressive behavior (given that there&#039;s nothing more important to do, such as fleeing). The attack would in turn cause annoyance in the other creature, and there&#039;d be a fight! Weighting in how scary the other creature is definitely doable as well~<br><br><b>Update 339</b><br>Spears, spears, spears. A loooot of trigonometry going on today, with how the spears are supposed to get stuck in a certain angle, and then keep that angle as the creature is rotating.<br><br>Also, gluing one object to another in a way that didn&#039;t render them apart when moving at high velocities demanded a pretty deep dive in the game engine. What had to be done was separating updates of graphical modules, putting it after the game object updates, and also pass down a parameter to all objects so they could be asked by other objects whether or not they had been updated this frame. And a lot of other stuff, haha. But now one object can be glued to another, and it will stick snugly to the right coordinate even if everything is moving at a high velocity.<br><br>Further spear stuff completed today includes ability to stick spears in walls, and lizards having their spear-reflective heads implemented to much annoyance when play testing. Nailing lizards to walls is also in, I had fun this morning dodging around a courtyard as a poor white lizard sat impaled on a wall and tried to hit me with its tongue. What&#039;s new from the lingo version is the ability of spears to hit decorative body parts, such as the limbs or head in the case of the lizard. The spear doesn&#039;t really hit those parts, but the chunk they&#039;re attached to - but it gets it rotation and a bit of its placement from the decorative body part, making it look as if it&#039;s stuck there. With lizard legs I also implemented the disabling of limbs from a while ago when they get hit by spears - it looks pretty tragic, but also pretty cool. <br><br>The actual spears still look like red sticks though, so you&#039;ll get to see them later!

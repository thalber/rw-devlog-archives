^ this is great advice and we will take it into consideration. As you say, for the revamp we are talking about 4-5x ballpark, so there is a lot of space yet to go in that regard.<br><br>Anyway, on an almost DEVLOG sort of topic, we managed to work a nice little write-up of Joar&#039;s procedural animation style (with new gifs!!!) into our first kickstarter update. So that might be interesting and worth reading even if you aren&#039;t a backer!&nbsp; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150105041820/http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/rain-world/project-rain-world/posts" target="_blank">http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/rain-world/project-rain-world/posts</a><br><br>(you may have to scroll through a bit of the usual fluff first though)

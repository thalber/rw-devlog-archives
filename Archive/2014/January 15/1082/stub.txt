The devs already stated their intentions and ideas for a bigger game; I&#039;d rather see funds be used for polish and improving the game than just cramming features in because of stretch goals<br><br>How do you guys feel about stretch goals?<br></div><br>honestly, we&#039;ve been sort of wracking our brains to figure out what to do for stretch goals that would generate some excitement but also wouldn&#039;t compromise anything. as Joar explains it, there is a kind of grey area no-mans-land between &quot;comfortably funding Rain World as it is&quot; and &quot;totally rebuilding as Rain World 2.0 so its super slick&quot;. We sort of use the analogy of Spelunky vs. Original Spelunky, although its not quite that extreme. <br><br>RW2 would guarantee all the cool jazzy stuff: multiplatform, internet multiplayer, much easier console porting, etc etc., but is still quite a bit out of our grasp at this point. RW1, we can probably bolt on some cool stuff beyond the original scope, but Joar is already stretching poor Lingo to its breaking point, so without actually doing the work, its unsure how far exactly we can go with it.<br><br>Which makes me <span style="text-decoration: underline;">very relieved</span> to see people say &quot;more rain world&quot; as a stretch goal, because we know for sure thats possible. <br><br>###<br><br>ALSO! We&#039;re trying to not be too annoying about KS stuff, but today Rain World is the Kickstarter pick of the day so I&#039;ve got to be that guy and say &quot;please share and RT and help us hype&quot; or whatever, because, hey now is the time to do that right??

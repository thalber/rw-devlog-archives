Thank you soooo much!&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231050607im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/grin.gif" alt="Grin" border="0"><br><br><b>Update 228</b><br>I realize that as I&#039;m converting the game to c#, the devlog might be less than exciting for long time readers, as most of the stuff will be old news so to speak. But I&#039;ll just go ahead and type down what&#039;s going on, regardless of the entertainment value <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231050607im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/tongue.gif" alt="Tongue" border="0"> This is a record of the development process rather than anything else, and perhaps the goal of it is to be helpful rather than entertaining. Also it&#039;s a good resource for James and I, to have our progress logged somewhere. This time though, I&#039;ll spice it up with being <i>even more technical</i>&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231050607im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/evil.gif" alt="Evil" border="0"><br><br>Multiple rooms are in! It went surprisingly easily, as happens once in a looong while when programming. I <i>had </i>laid some ground work, but it was still smoother than expected. Rooms are instances of a room class, and on creation they&#039;re passed a name. They&#039;ll go look for a text file with the same name in a &quot;Levels&quot; folder, and get their data from there. I&#039;ve written a little thing that can translate level architecture into text and back. <br><br>Then we have a tile property which is an &quot;exit&quot;, which can be hooked up to a shortcut. The game has a world map, which is essentially an array of level names and what other levels they connect to. If a creature pops into a shortcut and encounters an &quot;exit&quot; tile, the world map is asked about to which other room this exit leads, and the shortcut continues transporting the creature in the new room. Then the little in-shortcut representation of the creature reaches the shortcut opening, and the actual physical creature is spawned. <br><br>As of now, all levels are loaded simultaneously. In the future, I want to create some kind of &quot;lazy loading&quot; system, which loads levels as you enter them, and unloads them a while after you&#039;ve left them. That way non player creatures will be able to move about a bit on off-screen levels as well. We&#039;ll see exactly what this system will look like later on - either it could be a simple cap (max 5 levels loaded at a time, if more, unload the one that has been off-screen the longest) or something more complex (unload levels where creatures are dormant/dead earlier than levels where creatures are engaged in activities).<br><br>Lots of exciting stuff to do now! Almost can&#039;t decide what to start with!&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231050607im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/hand-thumbsup-r.gif" alt="Hand Thumbs Up Right" border="0"> <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231050607im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/hand-thumbsup-r.gif" alt="Hand Thumbs Up Right" border="0"> <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231050607im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/hand-thumbsup-r.gif" alt="Hand Thumbs Up Right" border="0">

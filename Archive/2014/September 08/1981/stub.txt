<b>Update 302</b><br>Did some misc animation work, including the infamous blinking head! I cleaned up some of the limb movement further, made sure that green&#039;s shoulders didn&#039;t stick out through its back, hunted some bug in the obstacle tracker, etc. One new animation available to the lizard now is &quot;wiggle&quot;, where the body wiggles back and forth. It&#039;ll do this when it&#039;s stuck somewhere, and also when it has no limbs at all to move with, in which case the wiggle animation makes it slide along the floor in an inch-worm like movement.<br><br>The big achievement of the day was setting up Visual Studio with Unity and UnityVS. After some tears and pulled hair James and I got it to work, and now I&#039;ve been debugging the Unity project from VS, so it&#039;s all up and running! <br><br>In James related news the last batch of songs/music experiments he sent me contained one track that was <i>super cool</i> - we felt that it represented an entire style that we&#039;d like to explore further. Maybe when he has dug a little deeper in that direction we he&#039;ll want to share some of it. It&#039;s really something else!<br><br>I&#039;ve been looking at my poor little lizards, and noticed that they have some locomotion problems. In particular the green one. After the limb work of last week I feel happy enough with how the movement looks, especially if I compare with the lingo version I realize that they do feel like they have a more physical presence this time around. The problem is not in the <i>aesthetics</i>, but rather in the actual physics of movement. They fail at some moves they should succeed at, they get stuck way too much, sometimes they&#039;re strangely unable to move in narrow corridors. I probably need to take a long boring day to just clean this stuff up, identifying the problems one by one and doing something about them. I want my standard lizard to navigate its environment competently, any incompetence should be added by hand in a controlled manner. Let&#039;s just hope that the problems are in the movement physics, and don&#039;t have roots in the path finder 0________0

<b>Update 274</b><br>So now I have the basics down for the abstract creature framework, and am trying to connect it all together, so that creatures can move seamlessly between the two states of abstraction. However it also means that I have to re-structure quite a lot of the stuff handling things such as how rooms are loaded and the like.<br><br>I&#039;m actually building some very fundamental infrastructure for the game here, so it takes a little thinking. Right now my basic idea looks like this:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141219115756im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2014/07/17/3Zcrg.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Each of the areas is a level of abstraction. The very core of a creature is the top left cell, to which the other components are attached according to the nature of that creature and the level of abstraction. <br><br>An example of how a command might move through this infrastructure is when a creature with an AI addon (the player for example doesn&#039;t have an AI, meaning that the entire right column is absent) is given a new destination. This is handled from the top level - the abstract AI, and then the command is passed down to the AI and the path finder in turn. Processes in the AI are going to change the destination a lot, but each time the new destination will walk down this entire hierarchy - that way, when the room is suddenly abstracted and everything on the realized level is thrown out, the destination will still have survived in the abstract AI, which remains.

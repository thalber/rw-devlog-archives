In the morning I did the crouch-and-strike behavior you can see, which is also graphically communicated by the head turning black as they&#039;re charging. This is intended to look cool, but is actually mostly a liability to them - if they try this against a moving target they&#039;ll most likely miss, and even though the lunge itself is fast there&#039;s the charging and a speed penalty after as well, making the net speed gain negative in most situations. The lunge is a little bit different between breeds, the green one has more of a bull rush, and the blue one has something akin to a proper jump which it only uses very occasionally (as it&#039;s a pretty safe bet it&#039;ll result in falling to death on any level without a floor).<br><br>The great technical challenge of the day was something you might not expect though - placing the slugcat between the jaws of the lizard. Now there&#039;s a huge complex system in place where a graphics representation can contain sprite <i>containers </i>as well as sprites, and a system for moving objects into and out of those containers. So the lizard has essentially an entire sprite layer between its upper and lower jaw, and when the player is bitten every player sprite is moved into that layer, while still being moved around by the player object. <br><br>These Futile sprite containers also nest, which is pretty cool - in theory I think a lizard could be biting a lizard which is biting a lizard which is biting a lizard... <br><br>Now that the system is in place I think it&#039;s going to be pretty easy to implement similar stuff for other creatures, so if a creature is supposed to eat another, or contain an object nested in its sprites in some other way, there&#039;s a framework for that. One creature can even have several sprite containers, why ever they&#039;d need that. Maybe something with two grabbing hands or something similar.

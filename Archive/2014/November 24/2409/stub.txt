<b>Update 362</b><br>Huuuuge step. Got the entire world up and running, with migrating bats and lizards spawning in their dens, later emerging to hunt, and then returning as the rain approaches. <br><br>Good news and bad news. Good news are that YYYAAAYYYY it&#039;s up and running! Everything basically seems to work - the creatures spawn, move about, you can encounter them, they don&#039;t disappear or randomly appear, the ai seems to be able to somewhat handle most situations. <br><br>Bad news are not really anything unexpected, it&#039;s just that in this new - vastly more complex - context every little glitch and lack of polish becomes more prominent. The lizards getting stuck, the AI throwing missing reference exceptions, the AI not always making the best decisions, all of that is now way more visible. In my previous test environment there was just a single room, or a few interconnected ones, and I&#039;d hit restart over and over while testing stuff. Now we have way longer sessions of gameplay, making every error stick around for a longer time and becoming more visible. This, in combination with the environments and situations being generally more complex and error-prone, makes for a generally more glitchy experience.<br><br>But, as I said, this was pretty much expected. Now the glitchy stuff is there, all visible, and I&#039;ll just have to hunt the issues down one by one. Everything essential and important is working.<br><br>It&#039;s probably too early to say anything about the game design implications of this new environment, I just haven&#039;t had enough time to play the game. I&#039;ve noticed a few things, such as despite sprinkling the world with what seemed like quite a lot of lizards, lizard encounters seem sparse while moving through the world. Maybe this has to do with the amount of lizards, but I rather think its about their mobility. I might want them to move more between rooms. <br><br>Gonna play the game a bit more! Brb!

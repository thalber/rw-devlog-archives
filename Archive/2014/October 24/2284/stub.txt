good question! Joar and I have discussed this quite a bit. Like you, I also dig a lot of the sounds in the lingo version, which have a pretty cool &quot;industrial but videogame&quot; feel. The ones we use we&#039;ll definitely want to spiffy them up a bit, give them all a nice sparkle of hi-fi, much like the visuals here where you can clearly see the &quot;simple pixel platformer&quot; origins, but there is a little more high tech zazz to them. <br><br>But don&#039;t worry about it turning into mass effect cut-scene &quot;bwaaaah&quot; hi fi audio or something. All the sounds and music in the game are synthesized from or processed through low bit hardware audio sources like vintage moogs, oberhiems, waldorfs and actual old videogame console sound chips (hey thats me!) Nothing goes above 16 bit, and its mostly just weird use of additive, formant and wavetable synthesis, which i feel complement well the otherworldly industrial beauty Joar creates so clearly with the visuals.<br><br>Actually, the whole reason i emailed Joar about this project waaaaaaaay back 2 years ago was that i had a nightmare (really!) that someone came along and ruined it with goofy vidya game sounds and music that completely destroyed the mood. So I have devoted my past 2 years 1000% trying NOT to do that!<br><br>also:<br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141219143400/http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.msg1076433#msg1076433">Quote from: muki on October 24, 2014, 11:24:32 AM</a></div><div class="quote">Flocks of piranhas.<br><br>Just sayin&#039;<br></div><br>totally on the same page as this&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141219143400im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/hand-thumbsup-l.gif" alt="Hand Thumbs Up Left" border="0"> <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141219143400im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/hand-thumbsup-l.gif" alt="Hand Thumbs Up Left" border="0"> <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141219143400im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/hand-thumbsup-l.gif" alt="Hand Thumbs Up Left" border="0">

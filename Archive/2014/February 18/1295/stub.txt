@Juan, ah I see... Uh, I was kind of happy to move to Unity because there was so much documentation, and here I am again hehe. But most of the problems I encounter likely won&#039;t be Futile-specific, so I think it&#039;s not a major problem <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150102091221im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0"><br><br>@dancing_dead, thanks! Checking it out! When it comes to the draw order, I understand that what gets drawn later ends up on top of what gets drawn early - problem is that I&#039;ve found no way to control this in Futile - they just seem to do the classic where they go by the order the instances of the sprite object was created. This does give me the possibility to do a hack where I start up like, 1000 sprites right at the start and have them idle outside the screen, then I&#039;d be able to manage them through some kind of function from which objects could request &quot;the highest possible sprite&quot; or &quot;the sprite that&#039;s closest to 870&quot; or things like that. But that seems like a really slow and limited way to do it. I&#039;ll do more Futile research!<br><br>@Bandreus, thanks! This is weird... I think that what I see might just be Unity&#039;s dev tools being confused by Futile. If I use only one atlas, I get only 1 draw call, and a framerate of 60fps with 15 000 sprites. If I use two atlases, I get a couple of thousand draw calls, and the framerate drops to 20fps. I don&#039;t really see what logic is behind that relationship... It&#039;s not like 60/4037 is 20.<br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150102091221/http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.msg996692#msg996692">Quote from: Bandreus on February 18, 2014, 10:11:06 AM</a></div><div class="quote">Oh, keep in mind texture swap (switching to another atlas) is not the only thing triggering a new draw call.

Once again, could just be Unity being confused. <br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150102091221/http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.msg996692#msg996692">Quote from: Bandreus on February 18, 2014, 10:11:06 AM</a></div><div class="quote">Yet again, just keep it reasonable at the beginning (don&#039;t put graphics for each entity in its own atlas!) and only focus on optimizing when it&#039;s actually needed.<br></div>Word!

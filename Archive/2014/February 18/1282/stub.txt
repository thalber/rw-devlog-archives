Thanks again guys <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150102091221im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/grin.gif" alt="Grin" border="0"> Futile + Unity seems really good so far!<br><br>Wooooooooooow. The performance of this thing. I just had it draw 15 000 bouncing little balls with randomized alpha and color. <i>Fifteen Thousand.</i> Framerate doesn&#039;t even seem bothered by it <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150102091221im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/crazy.gif" alt="Crazy" border="0"> If I try 20k some parameters seem to touch bottom and it won&#039;t start, but the limiting factor surely isn&#039;t performance.<br><br>Compare that to macromedia director, where I might maybe be able to have 150 semi transparent sprites moving around before things got slow. That&#039;s a hundredfold increase. I figure this is the renowned Power of the GPU.<br><br>Now on to stress testing the processor! I&#039;m gonna mock up some Rain World like physics (trigonometry heavy) and see how that works out. Fun times!

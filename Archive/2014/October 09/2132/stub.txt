Sorry, no update today. The morning I spent talking to James (and we did sort out some pretty important design issues, so that&#039;s a big step forwards!) and the rest of the day was mostly trying to get Visual Studio to comply. At the end of the day, I had managed to make it break on exceptions, but still not take me to the code for proper debugging.<br><br>@DarkWanderer, yeah, we&#039;ve been thinking about having some corpses as distractions, and it would definitely be a cool mechanic. The question is whether we want to introduce dragging corpses around - it might make the game tedious to be dragging heavy creatures after you half the time. As for attacking injured creatures, that&#039;s a really good idea - I think it could be implemented pretty easily by having the creature&#039;s &quot;scaryness&quot; variable go down with its health. That way some creatures might perceive a specific other creature as scarier than delicious - ie not worth it - until its health drops, and the utility comparer suddenly gives a positive for hunting.<br><br>@Sebioff, THAAAAAANK YOU, that was the trick! I had clicked on that thing, but while the game was running or something I guess? So when you tipped me off I went back and tried again, and it worked! Also thanks for the article on symbols, now I actually get it! :D :D :D I guess I&#039;ll run Unity for profiling and keep monodevelop up for breaking on exceptions, and then edit my code in VS. One day I dream to do it all in one tool, but now I&#039;m fine with whatever works for a while haha.<br><br>In case anyone was interested, the frame rate dip was because of the blue lizards fleeing from the green ones. As blue lizards are wall climbers, they have a lot of tiles that are accessible to them but that are not accessible to the greens. Every time they tried to evaluate a tile like that for how dangerous it is, they&#039;d try to ask for the tile closest to that one which was in fact accessible to green lizards. The Find Closest Accessible Tile To This Creature method used a spiral - like, I&#039;d start at the specific tile you wanted to get close to, and move in a square spiral from there until I hit an accessible tile. That&#039;d take quite a few iterations in some cases. Times quite a few path finding ticks every frame, times quite a few blue lizards, times quite a few green lizards... I&#039;m not really certain how to solve it just yet, but now that I know what it is at least I know what to solve! Awesome!

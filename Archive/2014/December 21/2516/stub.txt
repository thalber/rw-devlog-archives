The rain is actually a timer and a game over screen, there&#039;s no way to get around that haha! I do try to work with it cosmetically, and maybe I&#039;ll do something context sensitive for underground areas making it look more like death by flooding rather than actual rain fall - buuuut it&#039;d be a cosmetically different game over screen, not really different in terms of game mechanics.<br><br>When it comes to priorities, the chosen path here is prioritizing creatures and creature interactions rather than rain stuff. The rain exists as an important background motif in the world, but is not really a prominent mechanic, if that makes sense. That said, I wouldn&#039;t rule anything out. Theoretically we could do rising water, for example. But in order to have a flooding room that looks really good there&#039;d have to be some actual water physics going on, and that seems like it would be the main focus of a game (McMillens &quot;Spewer&quot;, for example) rather than just a side feature.<br><br>So, yeah, I&#039;ll try to make the rain and water stuff cool, but it&#039;s not my main priority - I&#039;m more interested in creatures.<br><br>As for level design / objectives, that&#039;s as much James&#039; desk as it gets, and I don&#039;t really have anything to add to his answer. We&#039;re really just starting to get a feel for it - James is slaving away with the level editor and is getting close to finishing a second region (if finish is the word, we&#039;ll probably re-visit pretty much everything as the actual big world starts to come together). There are pretty significant differences between how the first region he made played and the current one, so things are moving quickly and changing fast right now. The first region is obviously a bit of a special case by virtue of being the first - it&#039;s more of a canvas to try the brushes on so to speak. So yeah, as James says, when we have 3 or 4 regions playable we&#039;ll know way more about that stuff than we do now.<br><br><b>Update 375</b><br>Spent the morning making a dev tool that has been a long time coming - a &quot;accessibility visualizer&quot; which is basically a flood fill using a selected creature&#039;s movement specs. You select a creature, say Blue Lizard, then you click a tile, and it flood fills out from there to everywhere that is reachable from the original tile if you move as a blue lizard. I think this will come in quite handy, as you can now get a very clear visualization of whether certain areas in a room are reachable to a certain creature, and even get a hint of what to change in the geometry to open it up. Often quite minor changes enables the creatures to reach much larger areas.<br><br>With this new tool, some of the lizards&#039; stupid movement restrictions became too jarring, and I had to spend some time with that. So now lizards can move diagonally between tiles if necessary, and also drop down to surfaces that are not perfectly below the drop point. This latter change means that a lizard can drop from a platform to a platform below it that is aligned with the above platform, if that makes sense. Like, steer back in under it&#039;s previous position a little bit while falling. This opens up quite a lot of new terrain to them.<br><br>Lastly today, I started on a new creature - the first backer suggestion actually! It&#039;s a snail inspired creature, which we though would work well with this watery region we&#039;re working on. Don&#039;t know exactly what it&#039;ll look like yet, but the basic framework is up.<br><br>It has become quite a process to create a new creature! It&#039;s almost 15 minutes of work to just introduce the&nbsp; concept of a new creature to the game, with all the components that need to connect. But, once that&#039;s done, the modular design pattern I&#039;ve got going seems to be working (I&#039;ve really only gotten a glimpse of how usable it is today) and things start moving very quickly as powerful chunks of already written code are set in motion. Exciting stuff!

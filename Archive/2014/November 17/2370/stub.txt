Hm, ok... Maybe I&#039;ll hide the gifs behind links if they surpass 20 or 30 GB or something? Again, if anyone else has an opinion on this, speak up. I know there are quite a lot of lurkers ~ and as no one has said anything yet I&#039;ve assumed that people are happy with the format, so I think I&#039;ll have to keep it the same unless more than one person wants to change it.<br><br><b>Update 356</b><br>James and I have decided to do a push on adding back the core features to the game - we want to &quot;catch up&quot; with the lingo version ASAP. Catch up is a weird wording, as the unity version is insanely more advanced and complex than the lingo version already, but some of the more mundane features have been lagging behind. So, today I present to you: fly eating!<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141212163741im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2014/11/17/qLGg9.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>It&#039;s interesting how many things you forget has to be implented - for example I spent a couple of hours today adding the ability for flies to <i>be dead</i>, which was pretty necessary to proceed haha. The amount of weird little things like this, that seem to be so obvious that you tend to overlook them, has also increased further with the addition of water. Basically everything I do, I have to do twice now. How does a fly move? And how does it move when in water? How does it move when dead? How does it move when dead and in water? <br><br>For most land creatures the water behaviors are reduced to just a couple of lines that basically describe &quot;panicked writhing&quot; so it&#039;s not really as bad as it sounds. The problem is that there are <i>a lot </i>of these scenarios. A few days back I made spear and rock behavior for underwater conditions, and the flies and lizards seem to be handling it OK as well though the lizard AI really needs to be more careful not to fall in. The scary thing is that whenever I think of something that was in the old version, or something we&#039;ve promised to put in the new version, there&#039;s also the big question mark of how it&#039;ll interact with water. Pups + water? No idea, haven&#039;t given it any thought yet o___0 <br><br>I think keeping most of these interactions simple will be the best route. And despite all this, James and I are super agreed that adding the water was worth it - it does add a bit of extra work, but it adds way more in terms of gameplay depth.

Then after I get the world all stapled together, of course Joar is going to do another pass to add some REAL ART CRED, hopefully some dynamic set pieces, etc etc. <br><br>There is still one potentially significant element, darkness, that we haven&#039;t even begun experimenting with how it will be implemented. So if/how that plays out will significantly effect the number of regions and the shape of the game world. BUT... honestly at this point its just &quot;a thing ive been nagging Joar about&quot;, so who knows if it will actually pan out.<br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141219005940/http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.msg1091819#msg1091819">Quote from: gameaddictwn on December 14, 2014, 02:06:17 AM</a></div><div class="quote">Please tell me we can get a playable build by Christmas&#160; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141219005940im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/beg.gif" alt="Beg" border="0"><br>It would be the perfect present to the world<br></div><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141219005940im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0">

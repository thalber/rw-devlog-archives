Haha wow! Good morning everyone!<br><br>@kruxus<br>I think (<i>think</i>) that if the frontier is wide, the tiles next to each other on it will still have close relationships. And yeah, of course I&#039;ll add animation fluff, but as a fellow programmer you understand that I want to actually <i>solve the problem</i>&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141228135533im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0"><br><br>@Lee<br>Ugh you&#039;re right! But when chased by two enemies, a loop isn&#039;t worse than a dead end, right, just equally bad? Given that both the enemies don&#039;t decide to take the same route, in which case it&#039;s still preferable. And intersections between loops would still be a good idea to get to if you can do so while staying clear of threats?<br><br>On blinking heads! I think the black background makes it more visible - against the grey background the heads oscillate between two colors that have about an equal contrast against the background, one through hue and one through darkness. With the dark background the dark state of the head blends much more, which might make the blinking more in-your-face and appear more as <i>blinking </i>rather than a color change. <br><br>The robot analogy is actually not <i>entirely </i>out of place... The way I think of them is as Neon Lizards - they&#039;re definitely not robots, but they&#039;re not animals as we know them either. There&#039;s a slight biotechnological theme in the game, but not in the &quot;cyborgs&quot; sense - rather a smooth blend between one and the other, a seamless transition between skin and plastic. You&#039;re supposed to not really understand what you&#039;re looking at. Most of all though, this world is viewed through a cartoon &quot;filter&quot;, and then a pixel &quot;filter&quot;. When looking at a cartoon you rely on having seen most of the objects on screen in real life. They look nothing like reality, but you can deduce what they&#039;re supposed to symbolize. What I&#039;m trying to accomplish here is a cartoon rendering of something that you&#039;ve never seen before. In a situation like that you have to backwards engineer a reality from the meager clues that the cartoon gives you. Is this chameleon skin or light emitting diodes? The image is too simplified to know, so everyone has to make their own interpretation. That&#039;s what interesting to me about this visual style - things are just hinted with barely enough fidelity to try to piece together an understanding of what you&#039;re looking at.<br><br>So give me the benefit of the doubt! You could interpret what you see as &quot;Boring robot&quot; or &quot;Game NPC cheaply announcing its AI state&quot;, but you could also project whatever trippy cool shit you want on those images, and I&#039;m hoping you&#039;ll go with the latter <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141228135533im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0"><br><br>James animation notes:<br>Noted! All of these seem super valid. The new body elevation makes them appear more dog-like rather than lizard-like, so that definitely has to be tuned down. Looking at the old gifs I realize that the old lizards were much more of just a colored head and a black body &quot;sticking out of it&quot;, the new ones have become more animal-shaped. New ones are better in a few ways, but the old ones had a point that has gone missing. I&#039;ll take a good long look and try to incorporate the best of both.

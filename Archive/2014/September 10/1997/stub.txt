its all good! and seriously, thanks for your opinions. something is making it stick out for you guys to notice the difference, so we&#039;ll be sure to scrutinize it further now that you&#039;ve brought it to our attention&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141228135533im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/toast-l.gif" alt="Toast Left" border="0"><br><br>Joar is all wrapped up in fleeing AI, so this might be on the back burner for a bit, but I stared at these gifs for a while, and here are some thoughts:<br><br>* i think, sadly, everybody else is right and the tail gradients probably have to go. i got attached to them while they were just TAILS (no heads), but i have a suspicion that the visual contrast between them and the blinking head is probably one of the reasons its not sitting right with people. it just looks funky. (im sure we can use that trick on another creature to great effect though!)<br><br>* the new bodies really need to be lowered closer to the ground. they just lack that threatening sneakiness of the lingo. Seeing both pairs of legs for the walking animation also probably contributes to the visual color noise similar to above. And the droopy tail that results from the taller stance just doesnt feel &quot;predator&quot; at all.<br><br>* also reduce the size or amount of color on the feet to further eliminate the color noise. The originals benefited greatly from a less is more visual approach, and the small bits of color for feet allowed the viewer to sort of imagine more movement than was there. It seems contradictory, but even with the new well-defined feet and MUCH improved walking animation, the result winds up looking less natural, because the brain is silly like that.<br><br>* less stubby tails on the blues. the originals were lean and lanky which was threatening. its possible that might be solved just with the &quot;lower the body&quot; thing though.<br><br>OK! THUS SPAKE JAMES

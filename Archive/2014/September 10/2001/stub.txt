Hahahaha if you guys didn&#039;t notice the blinking heads until I mentioned them, maybe they&#039;re not that big of an aesthetical disaster after all &nbsp;<br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141228135550im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/tongue.gif" alt="Tongue" border="0"> <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141228135550im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/tongue.gif" alt="Tongue" border="0"> <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141228135550im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/tongue.gif" alt="Tongue" border="0"><br><br>I agree that something has gone missing in the smoothness of the new build though. Research will be directed at finding out exactly what!<br><br><b>Update 305</b><br>Dead end mapper! I think I&#039;ve managed to identify dead ends pretty well today, stay tuned for a million screenshots so you can judge for yourself!<br><br>When generating these I disabled short cuts to make it &quot;what you see is what you get&quot; - there&#039;re no secret passages between tiles, so what looks like a dead end in the image is actually a dead end. If this is confusing to you let me know and I&#039;ll try to explain better. Some images have something that looks like a very obvious dead end but is greener than anything else - those are room exits.<br><br>Essentially the way to read these pictures is that red is considered a dead end and green is considered a good area to be in in regards to not being cornered. The AI behavior I have in mind will be able to use these maps for a few things, but I guess the gist of it should be that if you&#039;re being chased, gravitate towards greener areas rather than running into the red. If your tile is redder than the tile of the threat, you&#039;re probably being cornered and it would be a good idea to find a path back to greener pastures.<br><br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141228135550im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2014/09/11/XwmLC.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141228135550im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2014/09/11/uebdf.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Same level mapped for Fly and Slugcat respectively. The fly obviously has access to air tiles, while the slugcat is stuck on the ground.<br><br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141228135550im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2014/09/11/Yi6Ld.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141228135550im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2014/09/11/qsxJh.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>See the pink tiles? Those are &quot;fleeing targets&quot;, essentially tiles that are A - in &quot;hub&quot; areas from where you can get to other areas without being cornered and B - somewhat evenly spaced. These are few and well defined for a reason - when a fleeing AI doesn&#039;t know where to go, it is supposed to be able to evaluate those one by one. Which one of them is closest to me? Which one is the furthest from the threat? Which one of them can I path to without the path intersecting with my threat? <br><br>In the difficult scenario of knowing where you want to get away from, but not where you&#039;re going, these fleeing targets might give a clue. If you arrive at your fleeing target and still feel panicked you can just pick another one and run around between them at random - you&#039;re at least guaranteed not to end up in a dead end.<br><br><br>Here&#039;s a little comparison - the same map, mapped for the fly creature, with shortcuts turned on and off:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141228135550im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2014/09/11/sdwFm.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>The rooms on the left each have a shortcut in them. Note how when the shortcuts are turned off these rooms are pretty much completely considered dead ends, no self-preserving creature would allow itself to get chased in there. When the shortcuts are on, however, they get a path through them, making them more considerable as fleeing destinations.<br><br>Last for today, a thing that I&#039;m not keeping but which ended up looking pretty cool - I tried to have the algorithm grow at random, and the effect ended up looking like a tesla coil, or veins:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141228135550im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2014/09/11/NeFOQ.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Edit: Just came to think of it, room exits should obviously have a fleeing target each as well.

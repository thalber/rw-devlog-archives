Thanks thanks thanks!<br><br><b>Update 321</b><br><br>The old lizard bubbles are back in:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229090357im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2014/10/03/bMaC.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>I also made a few impact effects, such as little water droplets. When I grab the lizards with the mouse and smash them in the ground (don&#039;t worry, these stunts were performed by trained professionals) there&#039;s really a lot of water, that&#039;s because the mouse movement impact speed is much greater than most in-game scenarios, and because there are three of them at the same spot. To get a feeling for what it actually looks like most of the time, take a look at when they impact the ground from natural falling.<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229090357im_/http://giant.gfycat.com/PassionateWeepyAsianporcupine.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>And one extra, for hilarity. I had forgotten that I had activated grabbing other creatures when I introduced the bats, so when playing with some lizards I accidentally pressed the wrong button and.... Hahaha this looks too funny! Just grabs the bastard by the throat like it&#039;s nothing!<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229090357im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2014/10/03/KeJOv.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>I don&#039;t think that the actual game will have the ability to grab lizards, and if it will, it will definitely be factored in that the lizard weights more - in this gif the lizard is just moved to where the player is, meaning it essentially has 0 mass. Also if the game was finished the lizard would bite you if you attempted this. So rest assured, there won&#039;t be anything that looks like this ridiculous scenario in the actual game, I just wanted to show it to you because it looked funny.

&quot;keep updating&quot; seemed to be the key, actually <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141227124122im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0"><br><br><b>Update 301</b><br>Ok, so I think I found a solution on the leg AI problem, and it was rather obvious and sitting there all the time. The solution was to keep looking for a grab spot every frame when the leg is lifted. That way it will start moving towards some place rather close to itself, and thus too far back, but as it approach it other more progressed spots will become accessible, until it&#039;s stretched all the way forward and can evaluate grab spots that are in front of the lizard. When it finally reaches a grab spot, it goes into grab mode and just relaxes until it&#039;s too far behind again. I don&#039;t quite know why every iteration of this solution I came up with had just one or a few checks for grab spots, when continuous reevaluation seemed to be the trick.<br><br>In other news I&#039;ve colored the paws of the lizards, and made the leg size change according to breed:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141227124122im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2014/09/05/4BcQA.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>I don&#039;t know if you can notice, but the pair of legs that are further away from the camera are slightly darker, I hope that this slight color difference will make it appear a little less like a flurry of color and make it possible to at least get glimpses of the leg movement.<br><br>The mystery of the slugcat&#039;s disappearing arms has also come to a conclusion. At one time or another when doing the lizards I told all limbs to go into retract mode when the creature enters a short cut, so that was what happened to the slugcat as well, only that the slugcat didn&#039;t have any way of un-retracting them.

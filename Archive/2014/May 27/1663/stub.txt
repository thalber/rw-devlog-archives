Yeah, I&#039;ll definitely be more suspicious of the editor from now on! The vita thing is really cool actually, would be fun to see the game on a handheld <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141227124049im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0"> Thanks for the heads up - now that you mention it we should probably try the game on a mac and a linux machine every now and then as well. I guess I had a little too much blind confidence in Unity to just export and have everything work - and to Unity&#039;s credit that might actually be the case if you use it as supposed to. But I do some weird stuff with Unity I guess, such as 2D and custom shaders, so it&#039;s somewhat natural that it&#039;s a bit more shaky I suppose. <br><br>What&#039;s up with the arms haha? They are actually the exact graphic from the old game, so nothing have changed there, that I know of at least! Anyways, note that they&#039;re not supposed to be cute fluffy paws, but rather skinny and slightly uncannily human like arms, as you&#039;ve probably seen in the concept art. That said I&#039;m also not too happy about all of the arm stuff, especially how big the hands become when grabbing a pole, so there&#039;s going to be some polish there for sure!<br><br>

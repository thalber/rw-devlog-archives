<b>the &quot;Joar is too busy hanging out on an island to bother with an update&quot; mini-update 281.5</b><br><br>So island or no, we took some time and talked about AI archetypes and what to do. The next step of that is developing the AI&#039;s &quot;tracker&quot;, which plots the expected position of a creature or object for the AI to follow when that creature or object is out of view. Basically, it creates a mental &quot;ghost image&quot; estimation of where it thinks that target will be via some criteria. For example: a lizard chases you around a corner and can no longer see you. Which direction does it take to continue to follow you? THAT&#039;S the tracker. As you can imagine, this has big significance for hiding, sneaking and plotting, AKA a bunch of Rain World.<br><br>Joar had 2 options for this: a tile-based method and a physics-based method, each with certain advantages: <br><br>* Tile-based seems more robust in general but suffers from a lack of granular resolution (1/20th as accurate as physics method) and difficulty predicting more &quot;physics-y&quot; shapes like parabolas (such as the arc of a jumping slugcat!), that might occur. <br><br>* Physics-based method models parabolas and gravity well and also has has the advantage of being able to easily and more accurately model the velocity / vector of an object to &quot;ghost image&quot;, but could potentially suffer from &quot;in-between state&quot; jitter and other weirdness.<br><br>So the decision was of course to do BOTH: Tile-based tracking for objects on the ground and then physics-based tracking kicks in for jumps (and perhaps flying behaviors.) And that&#039;s what he&#039;s up to right this moment!&nbsp; &nbsp;<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141225201523im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/hand-metal-r.gif" alt="Hand Metal Right" border="0"><br><br>I&#039;m getting assorted things prepared for PAX Prime, where we&#039;ll be showing the Rain World alpha again at the Adult Swim booth. Also, I don&#039;t talk about this too much in here, but the Rain World soundtrack is getting deeeeep: Well over 60 tracks written so far. Not all of those specific ones will be used of course, but the way things are mapped out now, 70-100 tracks might be where it ends up. Kickstarter backers could wind up with a nice 3-4 disc set. Quite a bargain! XD

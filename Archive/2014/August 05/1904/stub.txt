Still I feel it might need some digestion, and have instead started on the next (and last) module that will be shared by almost all AI creatures - the Tracker.<br><br>The Tracker module is basically a piece of code that makes creatures be <i>not </i>omniscient. It creates ghosts for each other creature that the creature knows of, and acts as a combination of visual processing unit, memory and anticipation/prognosis intelligence. <br><br>As James described, the Tracker runs a ghost for each other creature. When the other creature is clearly visible, the ghost will be updated to its position each frame. When obscured, the ghost will fulfill two functions - in the short term anticipating where the creature might be (it went in through that passage, it ought to pop out on the other side) and in the long term remembering where the creature was last seen.<br><br>This is the creature&#039;s &quot;internal reflection of the world&quot;, it can never ask the game engine directly for info on where creatures are, but always have to go through this sometimes incorrect filter. <br><br>This is the Tracker as it stands after one day of work. The debug visualization is a little wonky because the the laser is only displayed when the lizard sees the slugcat&#039;s upper body, but the ghost is set to visible mode on seeing the lower body as well. <br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141225201523im_/http://s28.postimg.org/p22i1aajv/tracker.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>As you can see the &quot;anticipation of movement&quot; stuff is not really done yet. In simple cases like this, when there is pretty much only one way to go, the ghost should be able to follow a corridor through many twists and turns. This is where I&#039;m planning on having the tile-based movement kick in - it&#039;ll move smoothly until it inevitably gets stuck in a corner, then it will start to evaluate its further movement options on a tile-by-tile basis.<br><br>Also the ghost should respect what tiles are considered accessible and inaccessible to the creature being emulated. <br><br>The basic framework for creating, maintaining and deleting ghosts seem to be working fine though. This system also potentially allows for multiple ghosts tied to the same creature, which could create interesting options where an AI creature could for example evaluate both options at a road fork or the like. <br></div><br>the gif isnt work for me for some reason. anyone else having this prob? i&#039;d LOOOOOOVE to see it

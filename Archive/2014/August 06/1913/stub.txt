My usual upload service wouldn&#039;t work for some reason, so I had to use another. Here it is again, anyhow:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141225201523im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2014/08/06/abWCU.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br><br><b>Update 283</b><br>Inspired by the occupancy grid article, I&#039;ve started developing a solution with another level of hierarchy. Instead of just the tracker owning a bunch of ghosts, each of which knows which creature it&#039;s supposed to be emulating, the tracker now have a list of &quot;creatureRepresentatives&quot;, and <i>those </i>have a bunch of ghosts each. When the creature is actually seen, this list is shaven off from the second position, and the very first ghost is put at the creature&#039;s position. When it&#039;s not seen, the ghosts are allowed to mill about.<br><br>I now have some basic ghost movement as well. It takes the allowed movements of the emulated creature into consideration, and moves to nearby tiles. It prefers to go in the same general direction as the creature was last seen moving in. When reaching a road fork it will sometimes split into two.<br><br>I&#039;d post a gif of a million ghosts splitting over and over until it looked like mayhem, but I&#039;m in the middle of transitioning to the representative system, so the game won&#039;t run ATM. Gifs tomorrow!

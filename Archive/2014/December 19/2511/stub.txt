<b>Update 374</b><br>Mostly maintenance work today ~ worked around some weirdness between shaders and futile unloading textures, and added the ability to place leeches in the world text file, enabling James to get to leech placement.<br><br>Other than that, some deep diving in the lizard AI. Sometimes I do some sort of aimless problem solving, where I just put the game in some situation and see what problems I can spot. When I spot them, I try to hunt them down and fix them, and in that process I generally spot around 6 200 881 more, so it&#039;s generally a process that can just go on for however long I allow it to.<br><br>This session I messed around with lizards looking for dens. For some reason they all started searching for dens immediately on spawn, even though they were literally crawling out of one, and I didn&#039;t like that as the den search is an expensive path finding operation. On top of that they also searched for a new den every time they entered a new room, which seemed pretty unnecessary. So I restricted that some, and noticed that the den finder wouldn&#039;t find a den that had the same coordinate as the creature searching, so I fixed that. And then I noticed that this new special case fed the critter a den position that had some nonsense tile position info as well, making it impossible to get to the den, so then I fixed <i>that</i>. You get the idea. This sort of stuff is not the most exciting, but by just combing over the game like this again and again I&#039;m able to untangle it, make it run smoother and generally work. <br><br>In slightly more fun news, I added some water light flicker under water as well - thought it was missing below the surface:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141222121503im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2014/12/19/jBTtZ.gif" alt="" border="0">

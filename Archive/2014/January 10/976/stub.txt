<b>Update 218</b><br><br>Thank you so much everyone for the help! &nbsp;<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150101200646im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/grin.gif" alt="Grin" border="0"> I think many of you have very good points - elements from the environment needs to be worked in there, and maybe we should drop the cat?<br><br>Michael and I talked some yesterday, and sent some images back and forth. One thing that came out of that communication was that I was more able to define what I want - I want something that&#039;s sweet &amp; sour. Sweet as in cartoony, sour as in desolate. When doing these logos many people have been suggesting that I should more or less drop the sweet and go entirely sour - which I don&#039;t want. My problem, on the other hand, has been that what I&#039;ve made is entirely sweet, not good that either. For it to be an interesting taste it has to have booth.<br><br>Michael works with an art collective, and they&#039;ve been helping me with a little feedback. You can&#039;t imagine how nice it is to have some kind of reality check, rather than just doing something and then staring blankly at it trying to figure out if it&#039;s good or not!<br><br>One thing we came up with was, the same as many of you guys have been suggesting, to give the logo a bit of texture as if it was part of the environment and affected by the rain.<br><br>Here&#039;s the latest (and hopefully final) version:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150101200646im_/http://oi41.tinypic.com/23wpe9d.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br><br>The cat is dropped, it added too much sweet. It will be featured only on the press page, making it more of an &quot;illustration&quot; rather than an integrated part of the logo.<br><br>Michael and his artists didn&#039;t like the asian signs, but both James and I do, so we&#039;ll respectfully disregard that unless someone can come up with a killer argument to leave them out &nbsp;<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150101200646im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0"><br><br>Still not 100% on the color - it looks less cute if you use for example blue instead of pink, but this pink/red is featured everywhere in the game&#039;s environments, and thus ties it together nicely. I&#039;ve tried to fade the color down some in order to not have it appear too sugary.

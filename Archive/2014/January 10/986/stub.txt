In the game, there are two alphabets you can see on signs etc. One has its aesthetic stolen from korean hangeul &#54620;&#44404;, the other is based on cyrillic/roman letters. These are the asian ones, exactly as they appear in the game. No entire fictional languages are created, I&#039;m sorry to say, as I felt that might not be the place to put work when creating a game without dialogue. <br><br>The signs are grouped into two words, so I guess the most reasonable thing to assume would be that it&#039;s a translation of the title. <br><br>The question of offence is actually kind of interesting. Many Swedish people can recognize how annoying it is when people ignorantly use ÅÄÖ for their metal band logos etc. Motörhead for example. They just seem to assume that Ö is pronunciated as an O, which is obviously stupid, because O is filling that niche just fine. Or they don&#039;t at all care about us and our language, but are just trying to create a cheap rip-off of our culture/aesthetics that is entirely for and by non-swedes. That&#039;s annoying too - if you like our culture, freaking take 2 minutes to look it up on wikipedia then!<br><br>I myself am guilty of this cheap rip-off crime, I suppose. <br><br>In the game it&#039;s somewhat forgivable, as it&#039;s pretty obvious that it&#039;s just a fictional language that you&#039;re not even supposed to decipher. But in the logo... IDK...

Thank you <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150102022734im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/grin.gif" alt="Grin" border="0"> I was actually pretty nervous to see whether ya&#039;ll would approve of it - it is my game and my decision and all that, but in the end it really does matter what people think. Like, something that&#039;s liked by 90% of people has to be better in some way than something liked by 4% of people... or defining quality becomes very difficult. So I want to make something that&#039;s my own, but also strikes a chord with the rest of you out there, and hopefully we&#039;ve gotten there.<br><br>My friend expressed concerns that the asian text made it look like many japanese box arts, which apparently tend to have a big title in roman letters and then a smaller one in japanese. I didn&#039;t really think of this, but when shown some examples I totally see that it looks similar.<br><br>The problem with this is a complicated postmodern layer-on-layer culture kind of thing: It <i>looks </i>like the creator of the logo is trying to imitate japanese box art, but the creator is an idiot, and doesn&#039;t realize that japanese writing contains meaning. Instead he thinks it&#039;s just some sort of decoration some games have, and tries to imitate it.<br><br>Basically it looks like I&#039;m &quot;trying to be japanese&quot; or &quot;trying too hard to be cool&quot; - and as we all know, trying hard to be cool is <i>not </i>cool. (Obviously I <i>am </i>in fact trying to be cool [I mean c&#039;mon, look at it], but if this is too obvious it doesn&#039;t work, accordingly to the <i>rules of cool</i>)&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150102022734im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/cool.gif" alt="Cool" border="0"><br><br>Does anyone else think this is a problem? I myself recognize the problem, but I suspect it&#039;s only a problem for those of us who are culturally hyper-sensitive or whatever you&#039;d call it, and that even we may perhaps be able to look past it. Although, when it comes to the kind of people who back indie games on kickstarter, I guess cultural hyper-sensitivity is to be expected.

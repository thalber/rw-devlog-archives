my argument for the faux language is thus:<br><br>#1. it looks awesome<br><br>#2. it adds an element of metatext that&#039;s a big part of the actual game atmosphere. <br><br>#3. it adds an essential element of incomprehensibility. <br><br>in the game there is a palpable sense of &#039;layers of history&#039;: the weathered dilapidated buildings and machines, objects that look familiar but who&#039;s purpose you cant discern, and a few varieties of vaguely recognizable text, as if different cultures lived in the same area over centuries of time. For me, this is all an essential part to reading the main character: an intelligent, tool using creature who is able to sense that there is meaning to the world s/he lives in, but that meaning is unknowable. this atmosphere is key, and the logo conveys that.<br><br>I don&#039;t think of this as &quot;fake koeran&quot; anymore than the other languages are &quot;fake Cyrillic&quot; or &quot;fake English&quot;. it is a remarkably effective way of conveying that uneasy sense of *almost* understanding, like reading language in a dream. removing all that because of the possibility a few people might misunderstand is a biiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiig mistake in my opinion. plus it looks rad, c&#039;mon.

Yup, parallel. The shadows are created with a pretty simple mechanic. As the level is rendered, is saves the depth of each pixel, ie how far into the Z dimension it is.<br><br>Now we&#039;re in the shader, and we&#039;re rendering a pixel P.<br><br>What we need to do is find a... let&#039;s call it shadow check coordinate S.<br><br>S is to the left of and above P. How much to the left and above increases linearly with the <i>depth </i>at P.<br><br>So if P has a depth of 6, S might be 6 pixels to the left and 6 pixels above P. (Except it&#039;s actually scaled by a factor in the actual game, and can have different angles that are not necessarily 45 degrees)<br><br>When we have S we do a check whether or not coordinate S is occupied by any sprite. If yes, then coordinate P should be in shadow.<br><br>What this essentially means is that if a wall is far behind the play layer, the shadows will appear far down to the right of the sprites. If the wall is close, the shadows will appear close to the sprites. But it&#039;s on a per-pixel level, meaning that she shadows can be distorted by different shapes in the background.<br><br>Simple as that! If you want to do some digging through the thread I think I did this stuff back in May, so there are more details to get there&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150108070339im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/hand-thumbsup-r.gif" alt="Hand Thumbs Up Right" border="0">

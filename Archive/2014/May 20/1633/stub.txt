<b>Update 140</b><br><br>Hahaha, one thing that I never would have thought would be a time sink was having the legs aim in on climbable diagonals when in the corridor mode, but when I opened the old code for that stuff I was greeted by some pretty high tech stuff! And because of inverted y-axis and other stuff, I had to re-create all that, which took pretty much a day :S In better news, the legs have some other animations more refined now, such as running up and down slopes, jumping, and the like.<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141228135528im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2014/05/20/l4Otx.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Just a little bit more leg work to go now, then it&#039;s arms, then the face, and then we&#039;re more or less back at square 1 with the slugcat in Unity! <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141228135528im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0">

It looks as incredible in person as the GIFs we&#039;ve been seeing. I must admit, I felt like I was terrible at playing it. I&#039;m excited to spend more time playing it when it comes out and getting a chance to learn to play it better!

Its possible we had more people playing it in one day at BFIG than 4 days at PAX Prime. and that was with the most slap-dash, ghetto &quot;booth&quot; setup possible&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141228135550im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/tongue.gif" alt="Tongue" border="0"><br><br>

Hi!<br><br>I usually don&#039;t work in the weekend, as I think a five day week is probably the better option in the long run, but this time I made an exception and did some polishing on the dead end mapper. Now it works like I originally intended it to - actually finding loops, and from every loop drawing a connection to every exit. Tonight when I do my actual update I&#039;ll throw an image of the slightly improved dead end mapper in there.<br><br>@ Sebioff, Jimbert, thanks! Just needed a reality check. I might as well implement those solutions then, if something like a million integers isn&#039;t necessarily a problem. I have been looking into Sparse Arrays some, as I think I could use something like that for the heat maps where the great majority of the level is just blacked out, but from how I understand it there&#039;s no way to get the smaller memory size without trading it for a more complex look-up process. And you guys have told me that if I&#039;m in a situation where I have to choose between burdening the processor or the memory, I should go with the memory - so in that case it seems unnecessary to go out of my way to go against that advice.<br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141228135550/http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.msg1061153#msg1061153">Quote from: absenter on September 13, 2014, 05:06:27 PM</a></div><div class="quote">I had a chance to play this game briefly at BostonFIG. It looks as incredible in person as the GIFs we&#039;ve been seeing. I must admit, I felt like I was terrible at playing it. I&#039;m excited to spend more time playing it when it comes out and getting a chance to learn to play it better! Very cool!<br></div>Thanks for dropping by! Sorry I couldn&#039;t make it this time haha! One fairly common complaint with the game that I remember from PAX was that the controls were difficult... So you&#039;re probably not terrible, it&#039;s just that the controls aren&#039;t as streamlined as they should yet. Some people learnt the controls intuitively while some where struggling with them, so we probably need to find some kind of common ground between all users here. I for one have been playing with these exact controls for three years now, so I&#039;m way too used to them to be able to evaluate them properly - I think that when we get down to streamlining the user experience we&#039;ll have to bring in a few people who haven&#039;t played the game before and watch them play to see what problems they encounter. Anyhow, glad you liked it!<br><br>This curve:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141228135550im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2014/09/14/FR8ft.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>is there a way to get a curve like this that fits <i>snugly </i>in a 1*1 square? I want 0&lt;X&lt;1 and 0&lt;Y&lt;1, and I want f(0) = 0 and f(1) = 1, but no X other than 0 should produce an Y of zero, and the same with 1. In english, the graph should hit the corners of the square perfectly. The one pictured actually doesn&#039;t hit the corners, if you change the steepness of it the graph will break out of the square elsewhere.<br><br>Edit: Yay! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141228135550/http://dinodini.wordpress.com/2010/04/05/normalized-tunable-sigmoid-functions/" target="_blank">http://dinodini.wordpress.com/2010/04/05/normalized-tunable-sigmoid-functions/</a><br>It actually really <i>isn&#039;t</i> a sigmoid I think, as it doesn&#039;t have e^-x, but it fulfills the same purpose.

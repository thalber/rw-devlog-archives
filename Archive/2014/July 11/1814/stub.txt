<b>Update 270</b><br>Woho! The path finding seems to be more or less at the point where I&#039;ll be able to get it as a general creature-nonspecific behavior. I will of course revisit it when I get into doing individual creature behaviors, but the general principle seems to be working! <br><br>With this victory, I moved on to creature-nonspecific path following issues. First up, making a creature follow a path through multiple realized rooms. The issue - a creature only has a tile-level resolution map of the room it&#039;s currently in, for the others it uses the abstract node system. This means that when moving from one room to another, it needs to discard an entire path finding map for that room and create a new one for the room it has entered.<br><br>Furthermore, when entering the room it can&#039;t just lose its orientation entirely. If its destination is a specific tile <i>within </i>that room, it needs to make a quick path to that tile. If the goal is in fact another room, and it&#039;s just passing through the current one, it needs to look at all the exits except the one it came from, and for the exit that has the lowest pathing resistance (closest to the target) it needs to create a quick path and fill in the cells in order to get there. <br><br>This last issue is what I&#039;m working with now. It&#039;s wonky and tends to give paths to random internal shortcut entrances instead, when it doesn&#039;t just crash the game. But it still feels good to be working with the ability to <i>follow</i> paths, not <i>calculating </i>them. Progress is being made!

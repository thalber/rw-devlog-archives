that is a really good question. the fluidity of the animation is tied to everything being per-pixel and attention being paid to that level of details, so scaling is pretty much out. plus, the unique way the rooms are created (30 layers of topography stacked, each with its own lines of perspective, which gives that kind of diorama-esque false 3d look) means that we cant just re-size the camera either, like you might do in a unity or game-maker type engine. so the solution we (eh, Joar) came up with is that basically were designing everything around a few key 16:9 and 4:3 resolutions simultaneously as to accommodate things like the PS Vita. Thats a bit tricky since it would necessarily include constantly taking that aspect into consideration for super basic things like object positioning within level geometries and even the screen switching mechanism, but seems to be working so far!<br><br>As for the soundtrack, I cant wait to start talking about that&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141219005940im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/eyebrows.gif" alt="Well, hello there!" border="0">, but we need the game content to catch up first! Seems like we are getting there though. Im putting together what might be the last few rooms for the second region this weekend. Then only 10 more regions to go!&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141219005940im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/droop.gif" alt="Droop" border="0">

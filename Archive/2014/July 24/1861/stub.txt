Yup, thanks! I hope we get some more material to flesh out the page with later~<br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141223101649/http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.msg1044404#msg1044404">Quote from: Gimym JIMBERT on July 23, 2014, 07:49:40 AM</a></div><div class="quote"><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141223101649/http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.msg1044226#msg1044226">Quote from: jamesprimate on July 22, 2014, 06:14:07 PM</a></div><div class="quote"><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141223101649/http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.msg1043768#msg1043768">Quote from: JLJac on July 21, 2014, 01:44:30 PM</a></div><div class="quote">Do you feel like sharing any of the ideas you had buzzing around your head? <br></div><br>uh guys, i think he meant &quot;ideas about how to implement abstracted creature behaviour&quot; hahah <br></div><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141223101649/http://gamasutra.com/blogs/ChrisSimpson/20140717/221339/Behavior_trees_for_AI_How_they_work.php" target="_blank">http://gamasutra.com/blogs/ChrisSimpson/20140717/221339/Behavior_trees_for_AI_How_they_work.php</a><br><br>edit:<br>Rewinding the thread I&#039;m not so sure it&#039;s the answer to that question <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141223101649im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/whome.gif" alt="Who, Me?" border="0"> however still worth looking at <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141223101649im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/whome.gif" alt="Who, Me?" border="0"><br></div>Not the current problem, but a super interesting read. As always, thank you so much for your input! I&#039;ll let this one brew for a bit and see how I can utilize it, I&#039;m sure it will we very usable.<br><br><b>Update 276</b><br>These last days I&#039;ve basically spent in angst about how to implement the creature abstraction. The problem is that this is such a fundamental part of the infrastructure - I can&#039;t really throw something together and then get back to it.<br><br>Yesterday I had a talk with James, and I think I&#039;ve been able to take a step back from the problem. This morning I had an idea. In the end, it seems unnecessary to do a full-scale AI for creatures that are offloaded. It kind of beats the purpose of offloading them, right? With that in consideration, what is the only thing an offloaded creature can actually do that will be able to affect you in any way? There is only one action a creature in another room is able to perform that&#039;s going to influence you. That&#039;s exiting the room - an action that has the potential to take it to your room. <br><br>So the idea would be this: Separate all the actions that include room traversal into their own category. Only these will be able to occur in abstract mode. <br><br>At this point, the list is pretty short:<br>&nbsp; * Random scavenging/idle milling about<br>&nbsp; * Returning to den as rain is approaching<br><br>To this comes a few events that could possibly be added in the future. <br>&nbsp; * Returning to den because of injury<br>&nbsp; * Returning to den to store food<br>&nbsp; * Going into adjacent room to investigate input from inter-room senses, such as inter-room hearing (to what extent this will be implemented is a game balance question)<br><br>So, the solution would be to strip off-screen creatures of any behaviors except these few. <br><br>But wait, doesn&#039;t this mean that the whole &quot;living world&quot; &quot;terrarium&quot; &quot;creature autonomy&quot; thing is thrown out the window? Doesn&#039;t this make the entire world become an illusion that&#039;s created in a radius around the player?<br><br>Not exactly. The idea is that in the same way as position etc is abstracted out there in the big world you&#039;re not looking at, AI is too. Creature interactions can still happen, but they (including the AI part)are abstracted to simple statistics. So say that a pup and a lizard is occupying the same node in abstracted space. Instead of a huge process of interaction between two AI&#039;s with path finders, tiles, physics, etc etc etc, the whole thing is reduced to &quot;4% risk of eating per tick while they occupy the same node&quot;. By simulating stuff in statistics like this, stuff will still be able to happen off-screen, but not simulated in the same granularity. <br><br>Going to try an implementation this afternoon, and hopefully things will get moving again!

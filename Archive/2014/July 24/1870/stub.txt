@whiteclaws, that first post is a pretty flawless description of what&#039;s going on, actually <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141223101649im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0"><br><br>@JIMBERT, yeah, there&#039;s a bit of that too. For example I intend to make it so that abstracted rooms can receive update calls at uneven intervals (perhaps depending on how far away they are) - in either case they might very well not update every frame. The longer ago it was a creature was updated, the more &quot;quantum&quot; it gets in a way - when it receives its update it will have correspondingly higher chances of doing things, and its &quot;time since my last update&quot; counter will be reset, pinning it down to a &quot;less quantum&quot; state again.<br><br>The pretty good news is that I seem to have escaped the stuck place I&#039;ve been hanging out all week. I threw together a little visualizer for the abstracted world so I could actually see the creatures moving about, and it naturally helped a lot. Now I think I&#039;ve got an angle of approach, and this ride is moving again!&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141223101649im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/hand-shake-l.gif" alt="Hand Shake Left" border="0">&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141223101649im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/grin.gif" alt="Grin" border="0"> <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141223101649im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/hand-shake-r.gif" alt="Hand Shake Right" border="0">

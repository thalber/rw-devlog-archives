Similarly to how you wouldn&#039;t have a baseball cap in a fantasy game because it&#039;s not fitting the setting, neither caps nor viking helmets are really true to the RW setting. That said, we do plan on having a variety of playable characters available, but we don&#039;t yet know if that&#039;s going to be a question of custom combinations of features or if it&#039;s just going to be a selection of characters to choose from. It&#039;s all much later stuff though, for now the general frame work needs to get done!

Oh, look at that! Don&#039;t think it&#039;ll make a huge difference to us though... or maybe it will, because UnityVS doesn&#039;t work with trial versions of Visual Studio, and maybe now it will. We&#039;ll see!<br><br><b>Update 265</b><br>Off screen path finding. I&#039;d say I&#039;m about halfway through by now - the accessibility mapping shown above is for example able to map off screen abstracted levels, and the path finder is actually able to go through them as well, but there are some quirks.<br><br>The main hurdle here was that on the realized map, every AI entity will share an AI map, but in the abstracted world they will each have their own. This is because the movements in an off screen room is pre-calculated for each species, meaning that you will get a different looking graph connectivity in those areas depending on what creature you are. This meant that those two maps, for the local, realized room and for the abstract world, had to be connected at the room exits. As this connection was between a shared map and a private, there was some trouble, but now it actually seems to be working. <br><br>Still some stuff to take into consideration though. For example it doesn&#039;t yet consider the pre-baked connectivity maps of abstracted rooms, it just assumes that any exit in a room is accessible from any other exit. But we are really close to having a path finding system that&#039;s universal and able to seamlessly find paths in a room as well as between rooms. <br><br>Then again, following those paths is going to be another thing entirely haha!

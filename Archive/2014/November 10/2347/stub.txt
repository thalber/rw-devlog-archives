Thanks :D<br><br><b>Update 352</b><br>Finally managed to make the AI understand water, <i>and</i> patch up everything I broke during that process. There are a few things still that need to be addressed, such as some system for saving whether a node in abstract space is submerged. Without knowing that, a room that exits abstract space could end up spawning a bunch of fish on land and a bunch of flies under water, or similar. Also it would be necessary in order to avoid weird off-screen diving by creatures that shouldn&#039;t be able to dive.<br><br>Other than that I&#039;ve added a health state to the lizards, finally enabling them to be injured and die. The injured state is handled by a per-frame chance of getting a bit stunned, which increases with how damaged the creature is. This works pretty well in my opinion, as it means that a very injured lizard will be mostly incapacitated, but if the random numbers line up it can get a sudden burst of movement, making sure that you never feel completely safe around it.<br><br>For death condition I&#039;m doing a similar thing, the lower under 0 the health is, the greater the per-frame chance that the lizard will finally shut down. However, there&#039;s also a 50% chance of death when reaching 0 health, and a 100% chance when health reaches -100%. It looks good so far, with some lizards collapsing immediately when hit by a spear while others manage to crawl a step or two.<br><br>Lastly I&#039;ve finally made sure that spears don&#039;t duplicate when off-screen, but thinking of how many time I&#039;ve written that already the gravity of the wording &quot;made sure&quot; seems to be dropping quickly. Well, at least the spears seem to stay un-cloned in the situations I can create right now.

<b>Update 351</b><br>Back at it! Today I added tools for creating and adjusting water in the level editor - I have high expectations for what&#039;s going to come out of that when James gets his hands on it. As so far we&#039;ve only added the water to already made levels, we haven&#039;t created a level designed for water yet. Going to be pretty cool to see what comes out of that.<br><br>The rest of the day has been spent trying to get the AI to have some basic understanding of the water&#039;s existence. Both flies and lizards are pretty hydrophobic, so in those cases it&#039;s just a matter of of marking wet tiles as illegal (which isn&#039;t as easy as it sounds, as there are a million references to asking about and setting the legality of AI tiles all over the code). I&#039;ve also created a marker for creatures that enables me to give them a somewhat more sophisticated relationship to water, for example they can be air dwelling but accept touching water at the surface though not diving into it, or water dwelling, or completely amphibious. <br><br>Somewhere in the process I managed to break some parts of the code that saves AI data to the level file, which really was the last thing I wanted to revisit this week, but it doesn&#039;t seem all that bad so let&#039;s keep our hopes up. I&#039;ll probably sort it out pretty quickly as it doesn&#039;t seem to be about the hexadecimal data storage, which would&#039;ve been the true nightmare situation...

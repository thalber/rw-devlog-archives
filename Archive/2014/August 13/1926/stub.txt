98% autobiographic.<br><br><b>Update 288</b><br>Ok, got some good progress today, even though it isn&#039;t much to look at. Quite a lot of the lizard animations are in now - it&#039;s able to walk, climb, crawl, turn on flat surfaces, reach across gaps horizontally and vertically, and drop down to floors below it (though not very gracefully). Coming up is the ability to drop to pipes and grab them mid air, this always fails miserably as it is. I might have to nail the upper body to the grab spot for a few frames so the lower body can do a cool swinging motion before the lizard gains control and gets up on the pipe.<br><br>What&#039;s cool here is that the creature is made into a physical object with forces pulling it along, rather than just a ghost like sprite floating along. It&#039;s really fun already to throw spears at it and see how it tries to re-adjust and find new footing to continue moving. <br><br>The body physics are going to be cooler than in the old game. Whenever no body segment is inside a tile that&#039;s considered legal to that lizard, a &quot;framesInLegalTerrain&quot; counter is set to 0. When any segment is legal, it starts ticking.<br><br>If this &quot;framesInLegalTerrain&quot; is above 10 (numbers are subject to change/diversity between lizard breeds) the physics behave differently - it is assumed that the lizard is in total control of its situation, and the velocities of the body segments are slowed down each frame, and they aren&#039;t affected by gravity. The body basically &quot;floats&quot; around. If the value is less than 10 though, the body behaves as any physical body in the game, and can be tossed around the level. Basically I&#039;m trying to get a good balance between the lizard being an agent and a physical body, where it&#039;s supposed to behave like a little bit of both.<br><br>In this gif I&#039;m tossing a lizard around as it tries to traverse this courtyard - whenever I press a button it&#039;s pulled towards the mouse pointer. The idea is that it should be able to continue moving towards its goal despite being antagonized like this - it shouldn&#039;t get stuck or be unable to adapt to a new situation.<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141225201541im_/http://fat.gfycat.com/CookedFrenchCur.gif" alt="" border="0">

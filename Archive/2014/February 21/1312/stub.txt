Reading through it, Im actually surprised how lucid it was considering I wrote it up at 5am after being awake for like 2 days haha.<br><br>Hadn&#039;t considered a postmortem. I&#039;m usually pretty skeptical of them because success/failure all depends on sooooo many factors, trying to point to this or that reason <i>you think</i> caused something just seems like a guessing game to me. Then you&#039;ll have other people planning kickstarters reading it and using those arbitrary opinions in their own kickstarters because &quot;it worked for Rain World&quot;. That&#039;s bad because even if the self-analysis were accurate, there is no reason the same things would work under different circumstances, or that other things wouldn&#039;t work better. We&#039;re all just leaves in the wind.<br><br>But that said, if anyone has any specific questions I&#039;d be more than happy to offer some opinions based on my (admittedly limited) experience <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150102024711im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/toast-l.gif" alt="Toast Left" border="0">

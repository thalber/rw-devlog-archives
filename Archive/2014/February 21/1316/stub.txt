Ok, I&#039;ll do my best!<br><br>Since Juan is actively engaged in a Kickstarter right now (good luck!), I&#039;ll focus on his first:<br><br>One thing that I can&#039;t deny is that Rain World benefited a hugely from media exposure. And while this may have been exaggerated to a degree by the relative lack of other games on kickstarter at the time (AND as stated, the fact that many were already familiar with the game), a great deal of it was cultivated through simple hard work of media outreach. <br><br>For the launch and major updates we sent out about 350 (short, courteous, content-focused) emails to every game-related site/magazine/journalist/blogger we could find, then kept in contact with them throughout the campaign. Further, we made sure that everything we sent out was &quot;worthy of coverage&quot;, with new videos showing off major aspects of gameplay, screenshots, gifs, and in-depth discussion about content and things like that; AKA &#039;things that people would actually be interested in&#039;, rather than something like &quot;hey we&#039;re 50% to our goal&quot; or &quot;we&#039;ve added these stretch goals&quot;, etc.<br><br>I don&#039;t have anything to compare it to, but as of right now our video numbers are: <br>45,000-ish on the kickstarter page and... actually about the same on youtube too, 45,000. For the youtube numbers, a HUGE factor in that was being posted on major sites like RPS, Kotaku, Joystiq and The Verge. I remember being pretty stressed after a big update went out and for two days the youtube plays for it was at like &lt;200. Then RPS posted and in a matter of hours it was at 4,000.<br><br>I don&#039;t know how much of this will be helpful, but please feel free to ask away, I&#039;m be happy to help!

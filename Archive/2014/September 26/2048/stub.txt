As is they&#039;re pretty straight on, but it could be cool to have some other behaviors as well. The white ones ambush, but the point of that behavior is that you <i>don&#039;t</i> see them sit and wait for you as they&#039;re camouflaged. I can&#039;t really come up with any situation where a passive behavior would be beneficial to them... But yeah, it&#039;d look totally cool.<br><br><b>Update 315</b><br>This morning I set James up with the level editor, and introduced him to the eldritch horrors that are its interaction design and general user hostility. Three years worth of &quot;I&#039;ll just assign it to a button, I&#039;ll remember which one&quot; has not turned out pretty. That said, he seemed to get a good grasp of it, and it&#039;s going to be a lot of fun to see what he&#039;ll produce!<br><br>Other than that, I did some more work on idle behavior, making them have a more reasonable way of tracking what to look at. Now they judge what creature to focus on depending on several parameters, such as distance, size of the creature, how intense the relationship to the creature is, how scary the creature is considered to be, and whether the creature is in view. Here&#039;s a gif with two lizard having their hunting behavior turned off, just chilling out and looking at each other and the player:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229083427im_/http://fat.gfycat.com/FaithfulPlasticAruanas.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Apart from that I&#039;ve been further tweaking overall behavior, and the big change of the day is that lizards now have a limited field of vision. It varies some depending on breed, but is usually around 180 degrees, meaning that you can fairly easily sneak by behind them.<br><br>Here&#039;s three lizards in a level without the player, tracking each other and moving about. The green one has an &quot;eat&quot; relationship to the blue one, but a pretty weak one, meaning that it&#039;ll hunt it if it doesn&#039;t really have anything better to do, and give up pretty soon if the hunt is not going well. The blue lizard has a similarly lukewarm fleeing behavior. If the player were to enter the room they&#039;d probably both stop caring about each other. The pink lizard is just trying to hang out, and you kind of get the impression that it&#039;s a little annoyed by the other two. The networks of little squares coming out of each lizard is a visualization of the Tracker, meaning that those are basically each creature&#039;s hypothesis of where each other creature might be. The pink lizard, which isn&#039;t really interested in any of the others, does very minimal tracking - basically just saving the last position they were seen. This slimmed down tracking behavior is one of the things I got done yesterday, I think. The blue and the green however run the full algorithm on each other.<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229083427im_/http://giant.gfycat.com/HeartfeltHeavyEthiopianwolf.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Have a nice weekend everyone!

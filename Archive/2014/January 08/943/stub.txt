<b>Update 217</b><br><br>I&#039;m breaking the &quot;don&#039;t show anything&quot; rule a little here, as I feel I need feedback in order to continue. We&#039;re in this situation where I pretty much have to finish the logo, a task that is completely out of proportion difficulty-wise for me, as you may know. <br><br>I tried modifying the old logo a little bit in order to make it less &quot;cuddly&quot; and a little grittier. What do you think?<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150101200705im_/http://oi39.tinypic.com/2mph1y0.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br><br>What I&#039;m looking for is basically something with a graffiti vibe that looks cartoony, but without looking like Care Bears. Like, gritty cartoony, if that makes any sense. And if it&#039;s somewhat legible that&#039;s a plus. Does this meet the criteria? For some reason I still feel like I&#039;m not <i>all the way</i> there.

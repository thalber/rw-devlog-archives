Hahahaha XD That applies to all of us on the internet though... So thanks for all the good work James, who ever you are!<br><br>And in life. We never truly know each other - everyone we ever meet is a &quot;whoever you are&quot;.<br><br>This has been philosophy corner. Back to Rain World stuff.<br><br>Thank you all for your support! This has really been a ride, and we are super happy and excited with the outcome. As you might have noticed, I&#039;ve been mostly absent from here during the kickstarter days, which is because I figured that the kickstarter updates would be more fun if their content was a surprise. Now I plan to get back to transparency and back-and-forth communication again, so you can all look forward to following me in real time as I wrestle tedious little technical issues etc. <br><br>My plan for what to do next is basically play corner with different dev tools. Do a tutorial, mock up some sprites moving and some collisions, functions, objects etc just to see how it works, then try another one. This obviously shouldn&#039;t take weeks and months, as we want to get started on Rain World ASAP, but I think it might be a good idea to try two or three different setups before making such a long-term decision.<br><br>First up is Unity, I think. You are all more than welcome to drop suggestions for dev environments that you recommend! I&#039;ll also go back to the last time we had this discussion and look through what people said back then.<br><br>Cheers!&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20200831060711im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/toast-l.gif" alt="Toast Left" border="0"> <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20200831060711im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/grin.gif" alt="Grin" border="0">

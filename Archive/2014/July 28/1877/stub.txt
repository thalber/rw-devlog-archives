<b>Update 278</b><br>My little test creature has picked up the good habit of continuous existence throughout rooms and abstracted node space. It is getting closer and closer to achieving an AI capable of handling these strange situations as well. <br><br>When realized, the creature has this big cool path finder that can do all sorts of stuff. When abstracted, the creature just has a path, which is nothing more than an array of coordinates in node space, which it will mindlessly follow if it can. Today I made it so that on abstraction, the real cool path finder will try to create a super simple path and feed that to the super simple abstract AI if it can. If it&#039;s unable to, the abstract AI can fall back on the abstract space path finder, but I think that&#039;s not preferable as I don&#039;t see the reason why a path should be calculated twice.<br><br>This seems to work just fine. I&#039;ve had the realized creature find a path in realized space where it needs to pass through abstracted space in order to get there. Upon abstraction, the path is passed down just as intended. This means that now creatures can become abstracted without losing their focus; if a lizard sees you, it will be able to calculate a huge detour through abstract space in order to get to you, and follow it all the way. On arrival, it will even be able to remember what it was doing, as a creature&#039;s proper AI is saved in a hibernation mode if the creature has a destination within realized space. <br><br>Next up - if an abstract room is realized as a creature is halfway between two cells, the path should be calculated, and the creature should appear in the middle of it.

so after a brief (2 hour) crash-course from Joar on the level editor basics, ive been on the world-building warpath. We&#039;re looking to be pretty ambitious with the size of the world (200+ rooms? id like to do even more than that), so this is what im going to be staring at for the foreseeable future:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229090357im_/https://i.imgur.com/tUK9zwql.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>A really significant change in the new unity build is that rooms can now be multiple screens in width or height, which opens up huuuuuuge possibilities for gameplay that i&#039;ve been mulling over the past few months. We&#039;re planning on using them as larger set-piece levels to base regions around for a dramatic effect. But first I have to get my level building chops up and do some tests with multi-screen room implementation. <br><br>Here I took inspiration from a level of joar&#039;s called&nbsp; colosseum, and basically just extended it into 2 screens:<br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229090357im_/https://i.imgur.com/QeHNJYfl.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>The red and black overlay lines indicate the multiple camera positions. in order to format for both 16:9 and 4:3, we&#039;re making each level work for both simultaneously. its a little tricky, but hey.<br><br><br>We can also go vertical, as this 3 screen concept that spans from a rooftop into the canopy:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229090357im_/https://i.imgur.com/dIFgj0Bl.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>That was one of my first multi-screen tests, so i flubbed the height a little. no matter, camera placement to the rescue.<br><br><br><br><br>A horizontal 3-screen concept for the underhang region:<br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229090357im_/https://i.imgur.com/mkRgq8Ql.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br><br><br><br><br>This next one is definitely my favorite of the 25(!) i&#039;ve done so far. A 5-screen set piece concept for the garbage pit region called garbageWastes:<br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229090357im_/https://i.imgur.com/aYGLNkYl.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br><br><br><br>Its a bit hard to make out in such a tiny picture, but imagine each one of those rectangle overlays is a 1600:900 screen. Quite Exciting!

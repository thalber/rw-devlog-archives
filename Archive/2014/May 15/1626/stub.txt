It&#039;s just round little balls, and it relies on their spacing being smaller than a tile for them not to end up on the opposite side of walls. But, it&#039;s just cosmetics, so whatever works. The physics for actual objects is a bit more reliable.<br><br>James pointed out that the new tail was a lot limper than the old one, which looked a bit stiffer and had more body to it. So I made a few adjustments - basically a stiffness that declines over the segments. The base is the stiffest, and the very tip is still slimy.<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141228135528im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2014/05/15/yPjbd.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Small detail, but it&#039;s that kind of stuff I love to do haha! This looks more like it, James? The stiffness and the stiffness decline are just hard coded variables, so they can be adjusted whatever way.

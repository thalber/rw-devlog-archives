<i>A</i> you say... Hm - in that case I&#039;ll have to do a little bit of thinking. I don&#039;t want the abstracted creature to be too heavy, as the very point of it is that hundreds of them should be able to run in the background as you play. But maybe there could exist a thing that goes over the abstracted creatures one by one and create &quot;fake events&quot; for them to react to - such as &quot;hearing prey&quot; which changes the mode from &quot;idle&quot; to &quot;searching&quot; for example. When the creature is actually loaded, this fake event engine would be replaced with the actual events of the room. Which would actually be a little bit of solution <i>B</i> I realize when writing this, but would perhaps hit the sweet spot between them. More on this later!<br><br>Today and probably tomorrow I&#039;m making a website for our company, Videocult, which is necessary to get across some business hurdles. One of those is getting approved for the Bizspark project and receive a Visual Studio license, so that&#039;s going to be a nice boon for the development process. But until then, there might not be real devlog updates - so see you guys in a day or two!

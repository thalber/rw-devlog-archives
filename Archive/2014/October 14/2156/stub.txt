I&#039;ve not done any graphical work on it what so ever though - as some of you might remember the white lizard is supposed to have a quite unique look too it - but here it&#039;s just like the others but with a white head. Don&#039;t look at that, look at the tounge <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141227133859im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/tongue.gif" alt="Tongue" border="0"><br><br>In the game it&#039;s just represented as a point lashing out, but the graphical module for the lizard improvises some rope physics-ish stuff on top of that, with the triangle mesh code from the tail. The tongue gets slimmer if stretched, and is allowed to curl up a bit when very relaxed. As it&#039;s spit out each point along it is given a slightly random vector, making it initially come out curled up as a package, to then later straighten out. I&#039;m very happy with this effect, it looks &quot;nature documentary&quot; as James put it, and a little organic and weird. Good times!<br><br>What&#039;s worse is the actual gameplay implementation. Lizards are a bit less good at biting you now compared to the lingo build - they used to pretty much be &quot;kill on touch&quot;, but now they have to have a more reasonable position to get a bite in. It seems that when dragging you in with the tongue, they generally don&#039;t tend to get that position in order, meaning that it&#039;s quite easy to get away in the time between the tongue releasing you and the jaws actually biting you - as you can see in the top gif.<br><br>I could make it so that they automatically get a grip of you if they&#039;ve caught you with the tongue, but I like that you&#039;re not necessarily 100% doomed once they get you. It should be a serious situation though, so maybe they&#039;ll get a little bonus in their bite check right after releasing a tongue grip, or something similar. You shouldn&#039;t be able to count on getting away.<br><br>If they miss you and hit a wall, there&#039;s a chance they&#039;ll get stuck there, which looks kind of fun. Each frame has a certain random chance that they&#039;ll get loose again, so they could be there for no time at all, or quite a while.<br><br>The blue lizard also has a tongue, but much shorter and less effective. While the white lizard will stay still once it got you, and try to reel you in slowly, the blue lizard (which is not considerably heavier than you) will rather use the tongue to let itself be dragged after you, which is almost more annoying because it gives you less time to think. However, the blue lizard doesn&#039;t use the tongue quite as much, and will miss you most of the time it tries.

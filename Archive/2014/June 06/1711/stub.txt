I&#039;ll check that video thing to see if I can upload something!<br><br><b>Update 251</b><br>The boring stuff isn&#039;t done, but it&#039;s functional enough to leave it be a while. I had a little talk with James about where to go from here, and it&#039;s probably AI - that&#039;s pretty much the main mechanic in Rain World, and the thing that would make this whole thing come alive again. <br><br>So, now when boring week is over, we&#039;ll briefly stick our heads above the surface before diving back into boring <i>month<b>(s)</b></i>. Those lizard AIs were a horror the last time, and this time around I have less knowledge of the platform I&#039;m programming in (making debugging harder, and oh god is there going to be debugging) so we&#039;ll just have to hope for the best hah!<br><br>Before that though, some throwables!<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141225201517im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2014/06/06/MbJux.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>And some sprites apparently, I forgot to disable them and stopped seeing them after a while...<br><br>The basic physics are already in by default which is why inheritance is the best thing ever, so I&#039;ve just messed around with the actual interactions.<br><br>I have some fun things in mind. Rather than the super simple system we had in the old build, this one has a more generalized system for grabbing stuff that will allow for more interactions. Each creature has a number of grasps - the slugcat has 2 hands, the lizard has a mouth, etc. Grasps can be used to grab objects, and they have their own little mini class which keeps track of the grabber and the grabbee, which grasp is used, which body part is grabbed, etc. Also every object keeps track of what creatures are currently grabbing it. I think a lot of fun interactions can come out of this - such as a tug of war over an item between two creatures, maybe grabbing on to other creatures and &quot;wrestle&quot; them, etc. We&#039;ll see where it goes.

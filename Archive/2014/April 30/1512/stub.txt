Thanks guys! Yeah, it&#039;s cg!<br><br>Hehe I don&#039;t know about the loop in the shader, it was there when I downloaded it.<br><br>It makes sense how numbers can crash it I guess, given how extremely slimmed for performance these programs are made to be... They execute like... millions of times per frame, it&#039;s gotta be o.0 Craaaazy!<br><br><b>Update 130</b><br>When I got a shader &quot;working&quot; (i.e. I was able to at least output pixel colors, and get pixel colors from texture coordinates) my next step was to import a Rain World level in order to start writing a prototype for my level background shader. In order to do that, I needed to tweak the level editor some. In order to do that, I needed to make the level editor&#039;s png-output work on my new computer. And this is Director we&#039;re talking here, so I have spent literally half of today diving in 10 year old internet forums searching for something that would put me at square one - where I believed I was when I woke up this morning.&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231050607im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/tired.gif" alt="Tired" border="0"> Found a solution though!<br><br>And, we have a historical milestone here - today for the first time ever, the unity build loaded a level saved by the director level editor!<br><br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231050607/http://oi58.tinypic.com/2rnbm1h.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231050607im_/http://oi58.tinypic.com/2rnbm1h.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" border="0"></a><br><br>Yes, it&#039;s super unpolished, yes it lacks slopes. Yes, the player&#039;s graphics is two space worms asteroids ... But still! This is the embryo of the actual game! It works! Levels can be saved, loaded, the player can move between them!<br><br>Tomorrow, I&#039;ll try to import a texture into Unity - stay tuned!

<b>Update 354</b><br><br>Today&#039;s gif is pretty monstrous, so I&#039;m actually gonna link it rather than embed it.<br><br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141212163741/http://gfycat.com/EvenCircularDevilfish" target="_blank">http://gfycat.com/EvenCircularDevilfish</a><br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141212163741/http://giant.gfycat.com/EvenCircularDevilfish.gif" target="_blank">http://giant.gfycat.com/EvenCircularDevilfish.gif</a> (gif version, warning! 40 MB!)<br><br>Effects for approaching rain! <br><br>Other than that, today has included a lot of polish in various areas. Added screen shakes for when heavy objects impact the terrain, sparks when weapons hit the walls, fixed a bug where the player&#039;s hands were invisible, and so on an so forth. <br><br>Oh, and maybe more important than that stuff - I made the picking up / throwing / putting down of items work. It&#039;s a pretty complex system that takes a lot into consideration - the basic idea is that you have two hands and can carry a thing in each (fly, rock, spear), but there are many special cases. For example, you can&#039;t dual wield two spears, but one spear and one other object is allowed. And flies have lower priority - if you are standing on a weapon holding a fly, the fly should be released in favor of the weapon, but only if you don&#039;t have a <i>free</i> hand to use instead. If you hit the throw button and are holding a rock and a fly, you probably want to throw the rock, not the fly... And so on. Basically a huge amount of special cases where the game should cater to the player and try to be user friendly.

we&#039;ve been working on the next gen version for so long, you forget how it used to be. its crazy to see the same sorts of scenes side by side. The frame rate difference is RIDICULOUS. And the gif is only at 30fps i think? in game its like 100fps+, laser crisp and smooth. Plus notice how much more depth and detail is present in the backgrounds?<br><br>The lizards in the new version are still lacking a lot of the &quot;personality&quot; behaviors that were in the lingo, so they look a bit &quot;im running straight towards you to bite you&quot;, but other than that WOW what a difference! The arm motions, the limping, the escape behavior. There is still TONS more to do with that stuff and it compares well already.<br><br>Still feel the throw motion is a bit off somehow. Maybe not quick enough arm? Also the spear rebound animation is pretty wacky, haha. BZZZOOOM! Could probably be slowed down if possible.<br><br>Yep, the lizard heads are armored to various degrees. The point being that you shouldn&#039;t REALLY be taking them on head to head unless as a last resort.<br><br>ANYWAY!<br><br>I just got back from a week in Korea studying rain world tiling with Joar, and i think the results are looking pretty nice:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141212172324im_/https://i.imgur.com/55PL17hl.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>non horribly compressed version here: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141212172324/https://i.imgur.com/55PL17h.png" target="_blank">https://i.imgur.com/55PL17h.png</a><br><br>Finishing up the first tiling pass on the initial area of Rain World proper: the ~25 room &quot;suburban&quot; region that will be teased in the first build... which we are planning on having ready pretty soon! <br><br>Gentlemen, it looks like this might actually turn into a videogame after all!&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141212172324im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/gentleman.gif" alt="Gentleman" border="0">

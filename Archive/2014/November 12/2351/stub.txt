I&#039;m trying to wrap up the mechanics I have to a playable state now, before moving on. That means a lot of tiny little things that needs fixing. Today I revisited spears - how they stick, how they do damage, etc. The new spear stuff in combination with the lizard damage stuff means that the game is much more of a game recently, which feels kind of cool.<br><br>The player has also finally got a throwing animation, if you look closely you can see the slugcat lean into the throw a bit, and some hand movement as well.<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141212172324im_/http://giant.gfycat.com/ImpossibleConcreteLadybug.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Other additions of the day include lizards being able to understand that they should return to their holes when injured, and the ability for lizards to casually attack some close by creature they&#039;re not actively hunting if they think the creature looks tasty, or are just generally pissed. <br><br>As it&#039;s becoming more of a game the differences in difficulty between Unity and Lingo version also becomes more obvious, and I&#039;ve been trying to tune that a bit. The difficulty was way too low, and now it might be a bit too high - but I&#039;ve implemented it so that it&#039;s dependent on a few breed-specific variables in the lizards that can be tuned up and down very easily, so we&#039;ll get there. <br></div><br>WOOOOW! That GIF looks like a quicker, smoother version of the classic lingo ones. Suuuper impressive!

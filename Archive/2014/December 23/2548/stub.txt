Glad you guys are having fun with the build :D It is pretty rough, as I&#039;m sure you&#039;ve noticed, but I&#039;m glad you&#039;re finding some enjoyment in it!<br><br>@Christian, thanks for the feedback! Agreed on pretty much all points. Addressing some of your concerns ~ the controls for grabbing a pole is actually only up, not x+up. Hope that makes it easier for you! Grabbing mid air is supposed to be a bit tricky, but both James and I have gotten really good at it so it&#039;s possible that we have too much of that element in such an early area. You can&#039;t enter the &quot;standing on pole&quot; animation from the air, you have to grab the pole with your hands and then get back up. Eating bats - yeah... The idea is that you shouldn&#039;t be able to eat them in the heat of battle, making them feel more like prey rather than &quot;collectible&quot;. I like the animal-like feeling of scurrying to some safe corner with your collected food to quickly munch it down. But maybe the eating should be a bit faster to make it less intrusive on the tempo. White shader bug will definitely be fixed! When I have final versions of all the shaders I&#039;ll write light versions of them for older machines.<br><br>Wall run is something I&#039;ll consider.<br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141227094626/http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.msg1094391#msg1094391">Quote from: cwearly1 on December 23, 2014, 06:42:31 PM</a></div><div class="quote">If you put &quot;1&quot; in the setup text file for each color, you spawn with one of each lizard!

The lizard will pursue you, but it won&#039;t be an inevitable insta-death. When it comes to stuff like this in general, things that make the gameplay smoother, there are like a million things to add, several of which I have solutions for in mind but haven&#039;t gotten around to implementing.<br><br><b>Update 377</b><br><br>Don&#039;t antagonize the snails!<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141227094626im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2014/12/24/1tKpE.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>The body/animation of the snail isn&#039;t done yet, still working with the head / tail / limbs / pretty much everything. Animating creatures really is the big time sink in RW development, but creature animation is also our main selling point, so I guess that&#039;s OK.<br><br>And in slow motion:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141227094626im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2014/12/24/fkKUW.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>The game is screaming for audio at this point! Would really like to see what these effects feel like with some juicy samples to go with them.

Will the newer music be thematically similar? What would the greatest differences be? <br></div><br>From that preview probably most will? A few of them CERTAINLY will, such as the last track which will be a reoccurring theme. Also multiplayer might wind up being a catch-all for the best of original OST tracks that for whatever reason dont make the jump to the new single player.<br><br><b>**WARNING: JAMES AUDIO RAMBLING AHEAD**</b><br><br>Idk, its a bit hard to talk about at this point since we dont yet have the the audio engine in place or the timing for the rain cycle decided on, we wont know that or the distances between shelters until we get more of the world built, etc etc. Things like &quot;tempo of play&quot; and &quot;how much time it takes for the player to get from here to there&quot; are huge factors in writing effective game music.<br><br>When I recorded the original batch of tracks (2 years ago!?), the game was pretty simple. everything happened by room: there were a few platforming rooms, then once you found a swarm room all the real action happened there, lizards, bats, etc. rain came every 2 minutes, so it was basically &quot;write short tracks that would play when you got to a swarm rooms and while rushing back to your shelter, until the deafening rain sound overtakes it.&quot; The layout of the world map was even hub-and-spoke style, so we didnt even have to worry much about the musics replay-ability, as once you cleaned out that swarm room you&#039;d likely not see that room again.<br><br>For the current version, while that essential mechanic is still fundamentally there, exploration has become a much larger component of the game. To capture the terrarium style and properly show off the AI, you now encounter creatures unexpectedly and bats migrate throughout the map. Swarm rooms arent locations at the end of a spoke, but nodes in a much larger network, etc etc. All things that alter the pace of play! Now we have a concept for a much more dynamic system for the music and audio based more by region, narrative and &quot;event&quot; than by swarm room.<br><br>Also *super important* is that the aesthetic of the game has evolved pretty significantly! It&#039;s easy to forget when you are watching the gradual shift of the devlog (over years 0_0), but I&#039;m sure you could see how music that would work perfectly well for something like this:<br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141225144917im_/https://i.imgur.com/WEntecA.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>would feel completely out of place for something like this:<br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141225144917im_/https://i.imgur.com/Z6dXHAH.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>even though the second is basically just the evolved current-build version of the first.<br><br>Long story short is that from my perspective, the music needs to be what takes into account the scope and pace of the game, adding a final layer of narrative and coherence, tying it all up. I would be totally derelict in my musical duties if I were to try to fit old music into a new game just because it was already written!

<b>Update 376</b><br>Snails are coming along. Now they can crawl on walls, avoid each other, and otherwise mill about. I have given them shells, and decided that for this creature I want to start trying out the idea of randomizing some features using the creature ID as a seed. So right now shell color and size are randomized ~ don&#039;t know how much of this will make it to the final game, mostly just experimenting. Randomized colors look nice, but a bit &quot;computery&quot; - you can sort of see that it&#039;s a computer generated color scheme. I&#039;ll bring in more weighted randomization into the equation I think, and hopefully the color selection will get more artful qualities. In either case I&#039;m happy with having a creature that&#039;s a bit more colorful, as quite a lot of the creatures in the game have dark color schemes.<br><br>Also, the snails&#039; niche in rain world as a game has started to take shape. When you (or any other creature) move close to the snail it&#039;ll pull into its shell, and then start to vibrate and click. The vibrating and clicking gets more and more intense if you continue closing in on it, until it finally gives a kind of super sonic click, a little sound blast or tiny explosion. This pushes creatures away a bit, and can stun them. Could potentially be fun in multiplayer as well, if you manage do throw (maybe? Don&#039;t know yet to what extent you&#039;ll be able to pick up living creatures other than bats) a snail at another player, you could possibly create some trouble for them. Snails that are affected by other snails&#039; clicks might decide to click themselves if they slam into a wall or something, so there can be some chain reactions going on.<br><br>But the real interesting part is how this interacts with water. The snail is amphibious, moving in and out of water as it wishes. The click is waaaay more powerful under water - right now I have it set to 5 times the radius/strength, which feels about right. This means that an irritated snail that&#039;s dropped into a body of water can stun pretty much everything that&#039;s unlucky enough to be swimming in there. And this brings us to the actual utility for the player - leeches <i>hate </i>these clicks. I have only just started on the snail/leech interaction, so I don&#039;t know yet if the leeches will actually flee from snails or if they&#039;ll just stupidly try to attack and then get wrecked, but in either case a snail should be able to clear out leeches pretty effectively.

Thank you so much everyone! Really means a lot to know that the tiny little details I spend hours on are actually noticed!<br><br>Answering a few questions - <br><br>No UI won&#039;t be a new game + feature, because it&#039;s the default mode. Maybe we&#039;ll have something like that you can hold down a button and see how many flies you&#039;ve caught so you don&#039;t have to count them, but we&#039;re definitely aiming for an entirely clean screen during gameplay. Inverted RW, heheheh, idk... really breaks canon, that one. But if it&#039;s fun it could be included as a secret or something.<br><br>Shortcuts - yes, super unclear where they lead at the moment. They are not graphically finished to look like they did in the lingo version, where it was a <i>little </i>clearer because they had little arrows at the entrances and the actual shortcut consisted of black somewhat visible dots, but even back then it was hard to know. This one definitely needs some thinking.<br><br>Environments - nope, I&#039;ve decided that the environments are going to be completely static. A bit boring, I know, but it was a sacrifice I had to do in order to have the shadows. Also it <i>would </i>have been a technical nightmare. The third reason is that as it&#039;s only me doing animation, it feels reasonable to focus the energy on creature animations. If some flower wiggles as you pass it that might be cool, but it can never convey personality or narrative like creatures, so it feels like more bang for the buck to put my hours there.<br><br><b>Update 322</b><br>Now when everyone is excited about the latest kickstarter update, I take the opportunity to do boring stuff! Sneaky like a ninja!<br><br>So today I fixed some lizard-getting-stuck scenarios. And made blue lizards able to climb slopes that are in the ceiling. Maybe when James wakes up he can undo some of the boring by posting one of the gifs that didn&#039;t end up used in the kickstarter update - where there any cool ones, James?

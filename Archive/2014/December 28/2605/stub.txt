Hahaha yeah, guys, since you opened that setup.txt you&#039;re on your own! Nothing you see from that point were you really intended to see... So have fun, but don&#039;t think of the experience as representative. <br><br>Cool that you saw a green one hunt a pink one, I&#039;ve never seen that happen and am actually a little confused about how it would happen o_0 I haven&#039;t implemented any such interaction yet. Maybe there&#039;s some line of code I forgot in there. <br><br>Adding lines to setup.txt won&#039;t really do anything more than create bugs, sadly, because the code on the receiving end of the text file does nothing but load the number on each line into an array. Also the game has no idea that there will ever be such a thing as a red lizard, as the creature template isn&#039;t defined yet. So, sorry, you&#039;ll have to break the game with what you have there already&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141230111418im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/cheesy.gif" alt="Cheesy" border="0"> <br><br>When it comes to the white lizards knowing where shortcuts lead, I think I mentioned some time ago that I&#039;ve made the decision to work under the assumption that the AI critters have omniscience of the level layouts. Path finding is <i>really </i>complicated and hard to work with already, and if you also added the complexity of tiles being unknown, and weighting between decisions like taking a known somewhat long path and exploring what could potentially be a shorter path, it would be hell. I literally couldn&#039;t do it. Or maybe I could, but in a game that was only and exclusively about that. Also, huuuuuge arrays of data would be required to save what terrain was known and unknown for each creature. And on top of all that I think the player impression would boil down to &quot;the pathfinding is bad&quot;, haha!<br><br>If the lizard is waiting for you at the exit, why don&#039;t you try just popping right back in as soon as you arrive? If you&#039;re already holding the direction key to go back as you exit, they shouldn&#039;t be able to catch you.

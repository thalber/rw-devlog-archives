hah! well there ARE reasons we didnt include whites, yellows, reds and blues in the actual alpha gameplay...&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141230111418im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/whome.gif" alt="Who, Me?" border="0"><br><br>every creature wont work well in every room or region of course. its going to be a combination of that specific creature&#039;s AI/skillset and the specifics of the level design / spacing of the region in which that creature exist that will make it an effective &quot;creature encounter&quot;. Each lizard isn&#039;t necessarily &quot;fight it mano a mano in a room&quot;. Some are designed to chase you through multiple rooms or other pop up unexpectedly. Anything done messing with setup.txt is basically &quot;debug mode&quot; and wont take into consideration any of that context we&#039;re working to create, SO... I wouldn&#039;t take too many things you experience while breaking the alpha as reflective of how the game will actually wind up being!<br><br>we are planning on eventually also doing a sandbox mode where you CAN just throw critters (who you have unlocked) into a room to battle, but there will be rooms designed specifically for that too

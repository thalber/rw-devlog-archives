Hehe!&nbsp; &nbsp;<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141228135528im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/cheesy.gif" alt="Cheesy" border="0"><br><br><b>Update 141</b><br>I thought today was going to be arm day, but instead I ended up doing a million little leg and body touch ups that I didn&#039;t really remember were in there to begin with, but are much needed to make things look cool. Now we have legs displaying different sprites if you&#039;re climbing, crawling, wall sliding etc, and also different body positions for a bunch of stuff, such as climbing a pole, sliding on a wall and more. There is <i>a lot</i> of hooking up the upper body&#039;s x-position to a 3 pixel wide sinus curve over movement and such, which maybe isn&#039;t very exciting. But the animation is what many people like about this game, and that consists entirely of those little quirks, so I feel happy about going over them again. Even more so now that I have a template to look at, and don&#039;t have to spend 30 minutes deciding if that sinus wave should have an amplitude of 2, 3.5 or 4. <br><br>This is what the animation system of rain world essentially is - it&#039;s actually not as procedural as you might think, because it&#039;s not just a magic formula that makes everything look cool. Instead it&#039;s heaps and heaps of special cases, hand crafted &quot;animations&quot; that are made more or less frame by frame, but not by drawing sprite sheets but by deciding what force should affect what body part at what time. The cool thing about it certainly isn&#039;t that it saves a lot of time, but that combinations of animations and smooth transitions between them can exist. If one body part is for example animated to do something, those motions might be defined in relation to the overall alignment of the body, which will make it look a little bit different each time depending on what else is going on.

Joar will probably chime in with a more specific explanation when he gets back, but as I understand it this camera swap setup is a workaround of some limitations we&#039;ve run into with unity vs. director/lingo. basically, unity has a much more strict limitation of image size than director/lingo does, meaning that we cant build multiple-screen levels in the way that we want to (ie. as one big ass PNG). our options are that we either have to scrap the current level editor, most current level assets and with it a good chunk of the &quot;style&quot;, or we settle for a slightly awkward camera limitation.<br><br>it&#039;s not ideal, but as rain world was pretty much built around the single-room/screen idea, it probably makes sense to keep that mostly intact anyway, with perhaps some multi-screen levels here and there as set pieces or to show scale, etc etc. so that&#039;s kind of what&#039;s being shown here. I think once it&#039;s being seen implemented on multi-screen levels that were made with this mechanic in mind it&#039;ll probably make a lot more sense in context.. but I guess we&#039;ll find out that pretty soon!

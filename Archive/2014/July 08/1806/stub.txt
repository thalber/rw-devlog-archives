@nilanjan, thanks! Yeah, surely a lot of pathfinding in this game hahahaha! Still haven&#039;t turned out to the nightmare I expected though, so that&#039;s something we&#039;re happy about <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20190719154654im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0"> Yeah, I guess it would be accurate to say that I&#039;m self-taught, not because people didn&#039;t help me, but because I never went to programming school. I&#039;ve taken one or two courses that involved programming though. In the end I think the difference isn&#039;t very big - in the end the bulk of the learning is about just sitting down and learning it by yourself, and then it doesn&#039;t do a huge difference if you&#039;re going to be graded on it later or not!<br><br>@wlad, thanks! Appreciate it! I wonder too haha... Some days, way too many hours, some days too few - I&#039;d guess it averages out around 8 hours a day.<br><br><b>Update 267</b><br>Today was one of the days it averaged on slightly fewer though, but I got some cool stuff done. Now we have a basic system for inheritance between creature templates, which will come in handy when it comes to, for example, the lizard breeds. If a creature template is created and passed an ancestor, it&#039;ll use the traits of that one as a base which will be modified by its own input parameters. So if I want to create a creature that&#039;s exactly like another creature, with only one difference, I can just tell it to inherit its trait and pass that one trait in the traits list to be changed. Good times!<br><br>Also creatures will can be tagged as not applicable for pre-baked pathing. This is because some creatures may have almost the exact pathing preferences (pink lizards and red lizards for example) in which case it&#039;s a waste to pre-calculate specific paths for them. The jury is still out on this one though, because it&#039;s just a few characters of data in each level file for each creature, and maybe the charm of actually having them all calculate their own paths might be worth it?

Thanks for posting the vids Christian! There are a few more out there in internet land, but i think those were the best.<br><br>Joar is off to NYC to explore for the next few days, so I figure its good time for a <b>POST PAX EAST FLUFF POST</b>! <br><br>Quick PAX post-mort:<br><br>It was a fun, exhausting, chaotic experience, but a very very good one. Even though we were showing an early alpha build, the reception was fantastic and we really couldn&#039;t have hoped for better. There were people that would come back every day to play for a few hours(!), and once we set up the 4 player &quot;party mode&quot;, there was a constant crowd and it was a lot of fun. <br><br>Not to say it went off without a hitch though. Since we were still showing the Lingo build, there were a LOT of &quot;duct-tape solutions&quot; and hacked together last minute fixes. The expected PCs didnt arrive, and so Thursday night was spent frantically re-coding bits and pieces to get the aspect ratio to fit the screens of the replacements. There were some very strange framerate slowdowns that seemed to be related to the number of USB controllers attached, but then when the USB hub was attached for 4 player it magically went away, so who knows!<br><br>The enthusiasm for the multiplayer really gave us some things to consider. Recently we had just been thinking of it as a freebie game mode to add on top of the &quot;real game&quot; narrative/campaign part (in hindsight, probably just because we were bored of it), but new players were all excited for a samurai gunn / super smash brothers-esque party game, so we have talked a lot about it and will definitely be exploring ways we can enhance that aspect as well, perhaps even having the story mode feed into it some how (i hesitate to call the campaign &quot;single player mode&quot; because we really want co-op as well) Anyway, you get the idea.<br><br><br>If you are interested in seeing some pics from Our Big PAX Adventure (if not, plz ignore the facebook slideshow nature of this post, we will return to regularly scheduled programming shortly)<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231171155im_/http://i.minus.com/ipGzrkdtloVS9.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br>Rain World on the big screen<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231171155im_/http://i.minus.com/iF4Chjz9nfKVj.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231171155im_/http://i.minus.com/ibm0pAPZA3dqfv.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br>the very first 4 player Rain World match ever! sooooo fun! a fan played 2 player the first day )the PC at the booth only had 2 USBs), then went home and brought back a multi USB hub so we could set up 4player for the rest of the weekend :O now thats dedication!

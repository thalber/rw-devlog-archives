<b>Update 277</b><br>Moving forward at a steady pace again! Today I managed to implement quite a few things, albeit small. Rooms can for the first time be <i>un</i>loaded to abstract space again. I have managed to get the object permanence of creatures pretty much down - I&#039;m unsure of how it happens when a room is offloaded as the creature is currently in a a shortcut, but I have the following scenarios covered:<br><br>* The creature comes from abstracted space, entering realized space - and becomes realized<br>* The creature exists in abstracted space, which is then realized - and so is the creature<br>* The creature leaves realized space, entering abstracted space - and becomes abstracted<br>* The creature is in realized space and is abstracted along with it<br><br>This is pretty cool. I can have a lizard move about at random (random movement in abstracted space is halfway done, not very fine-tuned yet) and at times it will enter a room I&#039;m in, at other times I might enter a room where it is. Cool stuff!<br><br>Another cool thing I&#039;ve managed is to summon a lizard that&#039;s out in abstract space to the current room - it actually does show up in the doorway!<br><br>A loooot of things still need polishing. The abstract path finding stuff isn&#039;t at all hooked up with the in-level pathing yet, making it so that as soon as the creature switches between the two modes it forgets where it was going. Sometimes there are errors and weird glitching around. Creatures are not spawned in the middle of rooms as if they were actually doing something when entering previously abstract space, but rather at exits with a confused look on their faces. The list goes on. But so do I! It feels wonderful to have solid progress again.<br><br>Happy weekend everyone!

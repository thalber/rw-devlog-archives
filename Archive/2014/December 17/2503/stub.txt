Are leeches always going to be hovering right around the surface of the water closest to the player? It doesn&#039;t seem like the player would even have a chance to venture far into water without immediately being weighed down by leeches. Maybe there could be a few more sluggish ones around the surface, &amp; when they get their first bite the rest of the swarm is made alert to the player&#039;s presence in the water. All of the sudden a mass of writhing silhouettes appears from the pool floor ascending towards the player&#039;s location. Currently I wouldn&#039;t even think of water exploration knowing a mass of leeches is already prepared to sink me. <br></div><br>ah yes fear not! we&#039;ve only been showing clips of the leeches once they are aware of your presence, as otherwise they are below the surface doing their thing and hard to make look good for the camera. unless they know where you are they just happily swim along and maybe hunt a bat or two. <br><br>also its not like the leeches are insta-kill! they are dangerous, but if you learn their behavior you can quickly, carefully swim through them (at some risk of course.) They wont be in every body of water either, just placed as hazard elements for rooms or if for some reason we want to limit a players time spent in a certain body of water. take this room for example:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141222121503im_/https://i.imgur.com/Tg0ZKBjl.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>the leeches only have access to the center tank, so in addition to navigating a series of underwater tubes without drowning, AND wall jumping challenges while racing the rain clock, you also have to deal with the possibility of falling into a vat of leeches which would slow you down further.<br><br>We&#039;re trying to avoid things like &quot;dont fall into the spikes&quot; and instead go with hazards that, while dangerous, you still can wriggle or fight your way out of.

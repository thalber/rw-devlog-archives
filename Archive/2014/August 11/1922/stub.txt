Oh, but the point is that after the plateaux it should become a 1/x type of curve, that approaches 0 but never gets to it ... I really love your graph tool! Which one is it?<br><br><b>Update 286</b><br>Today wasn&#039;t the best day, as I spent quite a lot of it messing with flight tickets and online payment and stuff. Still got somewhere though! Tied together some lose ends in the Tracker module, and fixed a few errors where it would throw null reference exceptions. Also made it able to call out to its parent AI when a creature is spotted, with a distinction between first time spottings and spotting a creature that it&#039;s already aware of.<br><br>With this a pretty cool mile stone is reached - the shared AI assets are done! That would be the Path Finder and the Tracker, which are AI modules that are going to be used by pretty much every AI creature. There&#039;s an asterisk after done, as they will be revisited to accommodate for the needs of the individual creatures, but they are done as far as they can be before starting on making the creatures. This means that the next step is a step away from these boring generic functions - now I can actually start creating some content! The first creature up is the lizard, I imagine. Stay tuned!

Hahaha woooow! So many ideas! I do like the fungus idea, but it seems like that is a mechanic that should be a game itself, rather than something you slap on top of a finished concept. Haha and as Jimbert points out, Halo Did It! But if you had a game that was more focused on containing (or spreading) the contamination and built mechanics around that, it&#039;d be really cool.<br><br><b>Update 341</b><br>Gggaaaaaaahhhhh shaaaaader heeeell revisited! <br><br>The coloration is obviously not the real deal (just gave it some colors that made it easy to see, won&#039;t use gradients when in the final look), but I&#039;m happy with the surface movement and how it exists in the 3D-environment. The surface is a triangle mesh, so I&#039;m hoping to be able to do some cool manipulations on it when stuff interact with it.<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141225224128im_/http://giant.gfycat.com/FittingColorlessEquestrian.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Here comes the funny part though - unity won&#039;t build with it (I use a screen coordinate passed down to the fragment shader, and that won&#039;t fly, apparently. There HAS to be some way around it though, they can&#039;t reasonably expect people to write fragment shaders without being able to ask about what pixel on the screen is being handled -___-). And even more funny, I wrote the entire thing imagining that it was snugly lined up to the level pixels, but when I resized the unity window - everything was suddenly fifty pixels to the left of where it should be! I had built it dependent on my unity window size... Well, the two problems are pretty much just one actually - getting screen coordinates (of the game area, not the goddamn Unity editor) and I feel pretty confident there has to be some solution for that. Hitting the forums tomorrow I guess, unless someone has any idea?

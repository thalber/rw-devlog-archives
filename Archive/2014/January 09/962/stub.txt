Wow, things are moving fast now! The timing for the kickstarter couldn&#039;t be better <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150101200646im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0"><br><br>As for selling the game vs it being free, right now seems like the most transformative few days in the history of the project, and thus might not be the time to make adamant statements. BUT, most of the time I&#039;ve been developing this thing I&#039;ve been a broke sucker, and I will always have a special place in my heart for other broke suckers out there, no matter where this goes. So if we end up selling it, pay-what-you-want or something like that would be the way to go. Or, in the worst case, I could pirate my own game hehehe :D <br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150101200646/http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.msg982170#msg982170">Quote from: JLJac on January 08, 2014, 07:35:17 AM</a></div><div class="quote"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150101200646im_/http://oi44.tinypic.com/21oyclu.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br></div><br>I agree with you guys on the ferret placement issue, and that&#039;s going to change. When it comes to the actual letter shapes... I&#039;ve been looking at them all morning, doing tiny changes and then removing those changes. The big question now is how do you tell <i>stuck </i>from <i>done</i>? I have no idea, they feel exactly the same to me. <br><br>Let&#039;s make a check list:<br><br>Graffiti influence [YES]<br>Touch of old black and white cartoons [YES]<br>Legible [OK?]<br>Wet, melting, affected by rain [YES]<br>Not too childish, it shouldn&#039;t feel like disney, dora the explorer, care bears, etc [You tell me? Idk... Less childish than the last one, at least.]<br><br>Yeah, it&#039;s all about that last one. It is a very fine balance right there, I don&#039;t want it to be the dark grim future like warhammer 40k, and I also don&#039;t want it to be Spongebob. I want it to be a cartoon, but a <i>dark </i>cartoon.

Many of these animation quirks are based on values defined in the breed object, meaning that the different breeds will have subtle differences in how they move. Still not happy enough with the head to call it done, but it&#039;s good enough until I have the rest of the creature animated and can get to the polish phase.<br><br>I also ported the lizard leg sprite sheet for the unity build, and have been fighting with some pretty ... interesting animation.<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141227124122im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2014/08/27/5hSGC.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>What do you say guys, still not really there yet?&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141227124122im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/cheesy.gif" alt="Cheesy" border="0"><br><br>At the end of the day it looked a little bit more civil:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141227124122im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2014/08/27/5HfoU.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>But the legs still need a lot of work. A dirty secret of my trade here is that the legs never really have looked <i>substantially </i>better than this, but the fact that everything is merged into a flat-color silhouette has really helped obscure some of the worst part (the joints where the legs connect to the body) while bringing forward the better parts (the tips of the limbs). I&#039;ll keep working with it until I find it acceptable with the legs visible like this though, and hopefully it will all look really cool when the final coloration is in.<br><br>One thing I&#039;ve started to notice is that the lizards probably take too small steps, this tip-toeing doesn&#039;t really look very menacing. This problem is in the &quot;search for a grab point&quot; code though, which is a pretty messy chunk of logic, so that will take some deep diving to sort out.

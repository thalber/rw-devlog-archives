Yeah... For all the abuse I&#039;ve been putting on Director, I&#039;ve gotta say that it has amazing consistency between the editor and the actual app, and between different machines.<br><br><b>Update 146</b><br>I have this policy on the devlog, that I should never write about what I <i>will </i>do, but only about what I have already <i>done</i>. This is because otherwise I end up in this weird situation where I &quot;owe&quot; work to you guys, and the next day when I&#039;ve actually done that work I have nothing new to say, so instead I write about what I&#039;m going to do tomorrow, and on it goes. Soon you&#039;d be reading my dreams and wishes rather than actual progress reports haha!<br><br>Because of this I don&#039;t have much to say today, as I&#039;m in the middle of a large boring technical task that won&#039;t get done in one sitting: making room sizes variable. The horror of this task is that the level editor is still Lingo, and a royal mess at that. The only good thing is that I&#039;ve given up on the code to a degree where I don&#039;t even care any more, so I just put in whatever solution works no matter how ugly or cluttered it is. The level editor is just going to spit out images either way, so if it&#039;s unoptimized is not really a concern. Also, if it looks like s**t is not really a concern. As long as it works!<br><br>The problem here is that I was so very confident that no level would be any other size than 52*40 tiles that I hardcoded those numbers in probably like a hundred places in the code. Today I&#039;ve been going over that (ctrl+f, ctrl+f, ctrl+f) and replacing it with a global variable for level size. <br><br>I&#039;m still nowhere near done, which is why I won&#039;t write a long story about what I have in mind for different sized levels (policy, remember), but I got as far as to make the level editor resize a level, save it, load it, mess with its settings and geometry and actually render it without the application crashing. The last words are key here, <i>without crashing</i>. Nothing behaves as supposed to, the cursor is seven miles away from where it&#039;s actually placing tiles, everything looks like a jumbled mess, it&#039;s completely unusable, etc etc. But it didn&#039;t <i>crash</i>!<br><br>Sit tight for more variable room size news! Tomorrow I&#039;ll probably spend a bit of time under the sun, but sunday or monday I&#039;ll get another chunk of this done, and by next week we&#039;ll hopefully be able to return to more exciting, less super technical stuff. Have a nice weekend!

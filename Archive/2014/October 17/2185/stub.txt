Actually there was a spitting lizard in the lingo build! So that&#039;s going back in! It wasn&#039;t sticky though, just pushed you around. But sticky would be way cooler! This is the red one though, the yellow one is the one hunting in packs.<br><br>Losing their tails... I think it would make them too much of a lizard, perhaps? They&#039;re a lizard-like... thing, not an actual reptilian. <br><br>James and I are <i>hoping </i>for bodies of water, for those exact reasons - it&#039;d give some ways to control progress. I&#039;m super particular about aesthetics though, so a graphically complex thing like water kind of depends on whether I&#039;ll be able to make it look good enough. I&#039;d rather not have it than have it looking sub par compared to the rest of the game.<br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141225224128/http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.msg1073124#msg1073124">Quote from: Christian on October 16, 2014, 12:37:51 PM</a></div><div class="quote">So the bottom white is hunting the blue lizard, the top lizard was hunting slugcat.

But yeah, they&#039;re constantly re-evaluating their targets, so they could easily do a shift like that.<br><br><b>Update 340</b><br>Yesterday I did all the fun stuff with spears, today I proceeded to get the boring stuff done! Such as having them disappear with creatures into short cuts, and then reappear (not duplicated!) and so on and so forth.<br><br>This in turn forced me to get to some other interesting stuff. I set up a &quot;health state&quot; class for creatures keeping track of their health, and what spears they have stuck in them (yes, I know this is macabre, but it has to be coded haha!). In order to keep track of what spear is where, I implemented an ID system, which also applies to creatures. It&#039;s really simple, every single object in the game (which is an actual interactive object, I don&#039;t label water drips and sparks) has a unique integer ID. This is accomplished really easily by having an integer in the main game class, and each time an object is created it asks to be assigned an ID, and the integer increases. No two objects will ever have the same ID! The upper limit for an int is more than two thousand million, so you&#039;d have to eat a lot of bats for it to run out. <br><br>Unique ID&#039;s are cool for a few reasons! First of all, purely technical stuff, such as when spawning a spear, the game can look through a list of displaced spears &quot;is this particular spear actually somewhere else&quot; and if it&#039;s displaced, refrain from spawning it. That way object consistency can be created - one object exists in one place, and one place only.<br><br>But it&#039;s with creatures that the possibilities get really interesting! Just off the top of my head - relationships between individuals could be saved. &quot;I&#039;m very scared of creature #6911!&quot; Or, and this one I know will make James happy, the ID can be used as a random seed for individual variations, cosmetic or behavioral. These would probably have to be pretty clearly communicated for them to be noticed, but they could be cool even if they&#039;re subtle, just knowing that the creatures are in fact individuals would perhaps making your interactions with them feel more personal.<br><br>Last for the day, I made a James friendly build so he can try out his level editor work! It seems to be running nicely, but some of the levels are not loading, so we&#039;ll have to troubleshoot that. All in all, a good week! Thanks for hanging around and talking, see you guys Monday!

<b>Update 147</b><br>Big fat technical task continues... Now I have the level editor interface working for variable level size - you can load a level that didn&#039;t have the settings and it&#039;s converted, you can change the size of a level and all the data will be updated accordingly, the geometry editor and tile editor allow scrolling around over a larger-than-screen level using the num pad and tile placement etc works as supposed to.<br><br>I have cosmetic tiles now, that can be assigned as a border around a level. They&#039;re treated as normal tiles with graphics etc by the level editor, but will be excluded when the level is saved and won&#039;t be recognized by the game. This is cool because then if you have a level that for example is just a flat floor at the top, and then just air from there upwards, you can crop the level geometry there but still have graphics above it. This will make levels lighter on RAM, and will allow pathfinding creatures etc to not store a whole lot of unnecessary tiles in their memory.<br><br>I&#039;ve also started to port the level rendering to this new condition, and it&#039;s coming along quite nicely. It&#039;s already able to render levels of varying size, though it is still a little bit confused about it.<br><br>When I got tired of boring level editor stuff I decided to mess around with a particle system for a little while, so now rain world has support for a cosmetic sprite object. The idea is that objects that inherit from the cosmetic sprite class should be strictly cosmetic, meaning that they have no effect on actual gameplay objects and can safely be discarded as soon as the camera leaves the room.<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141225201522im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2014/06/02/I4Ohm.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>This effect isn&#039;t going in the game, just me trying the sprite class out. I&#039;m glad to notice though that an entire room filled with about twice this density of sprites runs smoothly on my computer.

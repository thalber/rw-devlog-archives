I&#039;ll check out this LINQ thing :D<br><br>@eigenbom, that makes sense, I&#039;ll use static instances then!<br><br><b>Update 220</b><br>Copied the Space Worms unity project, re-named a few files, delete quite a few. Gave it a new name: RainWorld. Set up a game class and a main loop. Here we go <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150101015922im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/grin.gif" alt="Grin" border="0"><br><br>Then I talked to my friend, who gave me a few general programming tips, and boy am I happy I made Space Worms to filter out the absolute worst of the worst. I&#039;v been doing so many things wrong! Now I have quite a few things to study, and I will really try to keep calm and not get ahead of myself with RW development. Slow and steady takes the day. Most likely I&#039;m still not through my beginner phase (this morning I thought I knew everything there was to know about C#, but then I had that talk with my friend...) so it&#039;s pretty likely that none of the lines I write will still be around in a month or two. But it&#039;s a start!<br><br>&nbsp;<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150101015922im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/hand-shake-l.gif" alt="Hand Shake Left" border="0"> <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150101015922im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0">

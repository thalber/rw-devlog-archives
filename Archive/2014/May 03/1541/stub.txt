Ok, so I actually managed to mock up the thing I want - it looks a little something like this:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141230122801im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2014/05/03/C6Ogk.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>30 layers parallax scrolling voxel like 3D space renderer!<br><br>Even with the smallest level size and no shadows it still eats away at the frame rate pretty badly. I think I&#039;ll try to figure out some other solution.<br><br>Maybe the past two days make a little bit more sense now?<br>My original idea was to have all the layers in the same texture, and do a per-pixel raytrace layer for layer in the texture until I hit something. When loading a big texture proved impossible that original approach fell flat, and I&#039;ve been trying to find another solution since. Now I&#039;m pretty tired of all this though, and am contemplating to just have fixed screen positions. It would be nice to show the depth of the rooms like this, but you can&#039;t have it all. I still have high hopes for dynamic shadows falling across the geometry though - that could be done with just depth map and a pre-baked image.

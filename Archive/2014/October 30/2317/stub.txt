Our genetical engineers are on the task!<br><br><b>Update 350</b><br><br>That age old rain world question - <i>Where the hell will I appear if I go in this shortcut!?</i> - has been given some clarity.<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141215131928im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2014/10/31/Ykt9X.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Some feedback, what do you guys think? Am I overdoing it? To me it feels a bit too modern with the color fading - I&#039;m thinking about if it might be possible to have it look more old school somehow. Right now I&#039;m lighting the entire path up, and doing a &quot;wave&quot; of slightly lighter dots on top of that so you can see the direction it&#039;s moving in. And also I&#039;m having the destination arrow blink like crazy.<br><br>Note that in most scenarios you won&#039;t have any idea where to look for the destination arrow if you&#039;re playing the room for the first time, so I don&#039;t really think this can be communicated too clearly - however, it shouldn&#039;t be too visually distracting either.

<b>Update 258</b><br>Pathing is coming along nicely. I&#039;m not not making amazing progress, but I&#039;m also not spending all of my time hunting bugs - it&#039;s just trotting along. I have spent some time writing debug functionality though, such as the little dots showing what&#039;s going on. <br><br>Don&#039;t really have much to show as this work isn&#039;t very visual - but this is what lizard pathfinding looks like as of now.<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141219115758im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2014/06/25/AXCf1.gif" alt="" width="600" height="400" border="0"><br><br>What I&#039;m happy about is that it looks like I&#039;m going to be able to make a huuuuge part of the path finding code shared between creatures. Ideally I&#039;ll be able to have everything in the same class, and only outsource a few things to creature specific path finders. Those things would be, for example, questions of what moves are legal and what number of cells the creature requires per tile (which would be 4 for lizards and 1 for everything else).<br><br>Also I&#039;ve been able to make the path finder tap into the template creatures I talked about earlier, which is pretty cool. This means it can be given a creature template to path as, and it seems to be working. For example in the above gif you see some wall climbing attempts, but no flying, which would be present if the path finder was instead hooked up to the &quot;fly&quot; template.<br><br>The reason why I&#039;m doing this super generalized system is that I hope it will allow for more creatures later on. If I get this right, we might reach a point where adding a new species to rain world is easy - I&#039;ll just fire up a new template, write the path finding rules and AI stats, and the creature will be alive and path finding dynamically through the world according to its own interests. Seems far away, but we&#039;ll get there!

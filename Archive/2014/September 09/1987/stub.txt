ohhhhh, the &quot;cornered state&quot; suggestion from that second link sounds SO right to me: <br><br><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">One thing I&#039;ve done in the past is add a cornered state to the enemy. Put yourself in the shoes of the fleeing enemy. It is scared, it is hurt, it is fleeing and trying to just get away! Perfect mindset to get yourself cornered, which can be really fun for the player.<br><br>Once cornered, the enemy can do different things, ideally depending on the personality of the enemy itself:<br><br>They can cower and duck into the corner and wait for death. Only really works if you can convey those emotions. A single-character rogue-like enemy probably can&#039;t convey that without text or something. From here, the player could decide to leave the enemy alone, showing compassion. Could be really neat if the enemy then becomes passive. Or if healed, even become an ally of the player.<br>They could go into a blind rage and launch a last-ditch attack against the player, or unleash some kind of escape spell or skill; such as a squid squirting ink, or a lizard playing dead.<br>These are really more interesting than avoiding the corner in the first place. And are probably faster to compute, which will let you spend those cycles elsewhere.<br></div><br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141228135533/https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/16600/how-to-prevent-fleeing-monster-from-backing-himself-into-a-dead-end" target="_blank">https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/16600/how-to-prevent-fleeing-monster-from-backing-himself-into-a-dead-end</a>

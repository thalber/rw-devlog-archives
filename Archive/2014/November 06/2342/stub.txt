Most of our talk has been about business stuff and how we will handle the logistics of the project - maybe not the most exciting but very necessary, and it feels good to have a more defined idea about how things are going to go. However we&#039;ve also talked a little bit about how we want the world you play in to work. As you&#039;ve seen James has made some pretty extensive maps, and we&#039;ve been trying to flesh out the first areas a bit more which is definitely easier sitting at the same table. On top of that, James has had a crash course in the more intricate workings of the level editor, and we&#039;re hoping to be able to switch up to a new gear in actual content creation.<br><br>I think this division of work (I use the term loosely as we&#039;re both obviously going to be involved a lot in what the other person is doing) feels really good. Ever since the start I&#039;ve mostly focused on the small scale - how the creatures actually look and interact. The game design issues of the larger scope - how the world will look and how you&#039;ll progress through it - I&#039;ve generally been thinking of as something I&#039;d get to &quot;later&quot;, but I&#039;ve been worrying that this might not give it all the attention it deserved. With James giving those aspects some serious attention, I feel secure in that they will be just as good as they have potential to be.<br><br>So, all in all, good productive talk. We&#039;re sorry about the gif sparsity though, promise to get right back at it next week when things return to normal!

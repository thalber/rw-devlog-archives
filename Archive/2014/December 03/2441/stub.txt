<b>Update 368</b><br><br>The little blinking number is back:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141211031309im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2014/12/03/G7qS.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Together with a whole bunch of other stuff. We&#039;re working on a somewhat playable alpha, so I got some introduction screens in, as well as the game recognizing when you&#039;ve died, displaying a message and restarting if you hit enter. There&#039;s also a win condition that&#039;s as simple as can be - return to the starting room with a certain number of flies eaten. <br><br>Also, flies + rock/spear collision finally in, that was a long time coming! Still don&#039;t have it so they can be impaled on the spear, but there are so many little details like that so it doesn&#039;t really feel smart to get caught up in them. Game relevant mechanics first, then details.<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141211031309im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2014/12/03/GuWz.gif" alt="" border="0">

I&#039;m very interested in both game art and traditional animation, while I do of course also enjoy well executed 3D graphics.<br><br>What I find, though, is that an illusion that has much work put into it, whether it is the usage of parallax layers versus 3D rendering, photo-referenced colors or a hand-picked pallette, it&#039;s that the illusions that people put time, effort and love into, are the one that live and breathe the most to me. <br><br>Say, comparing Porco Rosso to Pacific Rim (I am so sorry), despite pacific rim using a system to set up the visual illusion that is far more like our real world, with an actual 3D space where things are taking place, the movie that helps my suspension of disbelief that most is still the hand-animated one, where 3D space is completely abstracted, calculated either by numbers or intuition by someone drawing on a flat paper.<br><br>What I&#039;m getting at here is that this &#039;lovingly crafted illusion&#039; thing that really gets me going, is something that the visuals of Rain World also brings me. I think this game is absolutely precious. Even if I never play it, just looking at gifs from it has already given me something on a &#039;spiritual level&#039; that I can bring with me into life and into my art.<br></div><br>Wow, this is such a nice thing to say&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141228135528im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/shocked.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0"> I really hope I can live up to it. If I can&#039;t, I hope you&#039;ll be able to hold on to that first impression of yours!<br><br><b>Update 136</b><br>Started porting the player&#039;s animation, which has a few quirks to it. There&#039;s a lot of manual work such as logging where the rotational pivot point is for each sprite etc. But I also have some bigger questions to think about.<br><br>One solution I&#039;ve been contemplating is to have a &quot;cosmetic module&quot; for each creature, which holds things that don&#039;t really affect gameplay such as tails and paws. Then I could just drop that module when the creature is off-screen, and save some CPU on off-screen creatures. Also it might be a nice structure to have in an object, all the stuff that actually matters in one place and all the fluff in another.<br><br>Problem is that then I&#039;d need to have a players&#039; cosmetic module, a lizards&#039; cosmetic module, etc, and then I&#039;d have an entire separate but perfectly parallel inheritance tree for those, which feels like a weird an un-pure solution.<br><br>Also, this feels like it could be a massive case of premature optimation, heh. Maybe I should do it the proper way, and implement what&#039;s easiest, run the profiler, and then optimize where it actually matters.&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141228135528im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/huh.gif" alt="Huh?" border="0">

<b>Update 287</b><br>Lizard animations are slowly coming together. But also I spent 40 minutes chasing my own tail (<b>WHHHHHYYYYYYY DOEEEEEEESSSSS THISSSSSS VARRRRRIIIIABLLLEEEE <i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">CHAAAAAAAAAAAANNNNGEEEE</span></i>!!!?!?!?!?!?</b>)before finding out that I had put a 1 instead of a 2 in a specific spot - the line was copied from another place and I hadn&#039;t gotten around to change that specific digit. By the time I found out I had commented out pretty much every line in the entire game, disabling physics, gravity, and the very force that holds creatures together. The game was reduced to some floating body parts drifting in and out through the walls. So then I had to repair everything after my furious bug hunt.<br><br>It&#039;s crazy how focused I get when something like that happens... Nothing matters except squashing that one bug. <br><br>Speaking of bugs, another old friend has returned: when enabling the lizard flip (when they turn 180 degrees on a flat floor) the good old behavior where they just LOVE to do that flip over and over has resurfaced. They&#039;ll see me, do a flip for fun, another flip in the other direction, then one more just for the hell of it, and then they need to do a last one so they&#039;ll actually face the correct direction before they start moving. It looks ridiculous. Giving the flip animation a pathing weight corresponding to walking seven times around the world doesn&#039;t seem to work, they just love the flipping all that much. Last time I came up with some weird solution where I wouldn&#039;t allow it to flip close to where it flipped the last time, but that was a hack, this time I&#039;ll try to find out what&#039;s actually going on...

Hehe Juan I just need to be clear about this, don&#039;t feel obliged to help me every time I ask for it, you&#039;ll end up doing nothing else <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150101203251im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/tongue.gif" alt="Tongue" border="0"> I&#039;m suuuuper thankful though :D<br><br>If I wanna do a switch case on class type for an instance, do you recommend converting it to string first? Or maybe to... enum?<br><br>On the tutorial, I did that one, and those specific settings aren&#039;t in there. Isn&#039;t there any text file with just all the functions of futile stuff anywhere? Like, if you can write &quot;Futile.atlasManager.LoadAtlas&quot; what else can you put after &quot;Futile.atlasManager. ...&quot;? If I just had a list of those commands I could experiment and try to figure things out, but now I feel like I&#039;m a bit too much in the dark <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150101203251im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0"><br><br>Edit: Like, here <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150101203251/https://github.com/robert-wallis/GameJamKit/blob/master/Assets/UI/UISetup.cs" target="_blank">https://github.com/robert-wallis/GameJamKit/blob/master/Assets/UI/UISetup.cs</a> it suddenly shows that you can call something called &quot;GetFontWithName&quot; on AtlasManager... So there are obviously more things you can do with it. There <i>has</i> to be a full list of all those commands somewhere, right?

Are you expecting to hit some other goal that would allow for fleshing the game out more? Like at what amount would you consider the game to be no longer &quot;bare-bones&quot;<br></div><br>thats a good question! a significant aspect of this kickstarter is to allow for us to figure out what resources we are going to be able to put into Rain World in the coming months, and therefore to a certain degree the scope of the game. we&#039;ve worked on this for years with no thought to money and would gladly do more, so its not about &quot;recouping expenses&quot; or &quot;getting paid for the work&quot; or anything like that.<br><br>the original goal was a figure that takes into account all the things that it would take for just Joar and myself to finish into a publishable state, including a little freelance programmer help on the side. the game itself wouldn&#039;t be &#039;bare-bones&#039;, thats probably an unfair statement to make and i feel kind of silly having made it, but i wanted people to understand that at that budget it would be basically limited to what the two of us in our basements could do. with more funding brings more options: new tools, better hardware, more time with awesome programmer wizard pros to help us out with things like internet multiplayer (and expanding the game in that direction), people to dig through code and port to new platforms, etc. all that jazz.<br><br>anyway, back to the actual question: i&#039;ve talked a little in previous posts above about the differences between our ideas of &quot;rw1&quot; vs. &quot;rw2.0&quot;, and it seems like a decent version of rw2.0 starts to be become feasible at around 100k KS (minus fees and related expenses). So, we&#039;re still a long way to go before that discussion!<br><br>but in related, amazing news: only $600 to goal!!!

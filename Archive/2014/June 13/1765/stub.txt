Yeah, they probably took more time than any other identifiable &quot;things&quot;, though that still wouldn&#039;t be enough to make them the majority of the time spent as there are in fact many many more &quot;things&quot; than you&#039;d expect. Making the menu work, saving and loading levels correctly, making UI for the level editor etc etc etc are all tasks that have taken a lot of time as well!<br><br><b>Update 255</b><br>Speaking of which, we&#039;re in the middle of one of those kind of tasks right now! What I&#039;m currently doing is setting up the very framework for the rain world - a bunch of levels that are interconnected. Today I managed to load a world structure from a text file. This I hope will make it easier for me to do changes, and also helps me separate data and functionality in a way I wouldn&#039;t be able to if I just built the world by having a bunch of commands and hard coded level names in the actual code.<br><br>So basically there is a World class, which has an AbstractRoom object for each room that exists on the map. This is a very simple little object that basically only knows what other rooms it&#039;s connected to and what its level name is - the level that will be loaded if the player enters this room.<br><br>What&#039;s the purpose of this? It&#039;s that now the entire world &quot;exists&quot;, though in an extremely abstracted form, even if it&#039;s not currently loaded. Rooms that are off screen can be asked for basic properties, such as what other rooms they&#039;re connected to. Also, each of this AbstractRooms have a reference to an <i>actual </i>loaded active room, though most of them will just be referencing null most of the time. When you exit the room you&#039;re currently in an enter the next one, the game will fire up a new room object according to your new world coordinate, and place you in it. Eventually I&#039;ll want to unload rooms after you exit them as well, but I&#039;ll get to that when I see how much of a memory concern it actually becomes. I think it would be kind of cool to have the rooms live a little while after you&#039;ve exited them if there are creatures in there, so you can go back and see that events have been happening. <br><br>Soooo... weren&#039;t I supposed to make pathfinding AI? Yeah! I&#039;m just preparing everything for when I get into some serious A* implementations. Without breaking the policy of not telling in advance too much I can at least say that I want the creatures to be able to take other rooms than the ones they&#039;re currently in into consideration in their AI - that&#039;s why I need to create the world they&#039;re to move through before I get down to actually making them run around.<br><br>Today the first step has been taken to putting the World in Rain World, so that&#039;s a pretty huge improvement even if the game looks and behaves exactly the same as yesterday. That&#039;s the kind of thing you learn to appreciate as a programmer, I guess <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141219115754im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0">

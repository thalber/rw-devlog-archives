<b>Update 360</b><br>Started on a big scary thing called Flies World AI. This entity is supposed to coordinate flies on a world level, through abstract and realized rooms alike. <br><br>What it can do so far is create dijsktra maps in the abstract world, mapping the distance to each swarm room for each room. Any room (or node actually) can ask the world AI for a &quot;migration direction&quot;, ie a neighboring room that flies in this room should migrate towards. Depending on what mode the World AI is in, it will calculate this migration direction depending on different criteria. <br><br>Right now I have two such modes set up: spread and swarm. In the spread mode, the migration direction of any room will be the neighboring room with the <i>least </i>flies in it. This means that the flies will spread evenly throughout the entire world. The swarm behavior has flies move towards the nearest swarm room. <br><br>Both of these seem to work nicely! I can have a lot of flies gather in a room, and then go to the next room and start the &quot;spread&quot; behavior. Soon flies will come out of the swarm room, and spread out in every direction. Then if I switch back, I can see them emerge from all over to gather in the swarm room again. <br><br>Next step is to create some swarming behaviors that actually make sense, and tie them to the rain cycle.

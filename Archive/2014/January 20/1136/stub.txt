It&#039;s a good marketing move (yay, new better tech!), but ultimately I think RW looks great as is, and being dependant on a new programmer to achieve what you&#039;ve already achieved is a huge risk. I also really think this game will shine in its simplicity, and having more dynamic and larger levels that break the &#039;single scene&#039; format we&#039;ve all seen so far doesn&#039;t sound like it would add much.<br></div><br>I&#039;d love for Joar to go in some depth here, but he&#039;s slaving away at code as we speak, so for now please take my modest understanding of the situation and perhaps we can get him in later:&nbsp; <br><br>there is no intention to move outside of the structure of the game as you see it now. we hoped to make that clear in the update: Joar has a very strong idea of what he wants rain world to be, and the tools currently being used are a limitation to actually achieving that. the reason that Unity was chosen specifically is that Unityscript shares a lot of similarities with Lingo, and thus we will be able to migrate most of the current code (and hopefully all the art assets) with relatively minor tweaks.&nbsp; were not trying to make Rain World 3D here, just get it so it runs nicely and looks as good as it can! further, there wouldn&#039;t be a second programmer writing the game play of rain world or anything, rather someone who is familiar with the things we are not helping with things such as porting and Unity-specific tricks.<br><br>I hope that clarifies some!

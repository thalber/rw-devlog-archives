thanks all for the kind words! we&#039;re working hard on getting some interesting updates and new directions up in the next day or so, ill post more then.<br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150105070755/http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.msg985971#msg985971">Quote from: gamedev123 on January 19, 2014, 11:24:40 AM</a></div><div class="quote">Since you&#039;re going to add a C++ programmer post Kickstarter, can I assume you&#039;re moving to another engine/SDK?&nbsp; Or perhaps you&#039;re building an Xtra extension to increase performance?<br></div><br>very much so looking into those options! we&#039;re in a sort of interesting position because the game as it is now, Joar is basically straining Lingo as far as it can go. Many of the things that people are requesting and we&#039;d like to do (especially ports to other platforms/consoles) would likely require migrating/re-building the entire game into another programming language. By all accounts, that would be the best thing for Rain World, BUT its expensive and tedious, so we&#039;d need to make sure that the resources are in place first and its, well, not completely impossible. More on this soon i hope!

Yeah, excatly! Like, when a level has geometry that just goes on the same in one direction or another, those tiles needn&#039;t be stored -<br><br>Hahaha, it seems I&#039;ve dropped a hundred updates somehow. We&#039;re actually at<br><br><b>Update 248</b><br>Operation level editor overhaul is progressing. The sub editor for placing cameras is working now, with saving and loading etc. Also the rendering saves one image for each camera, so that seems to be up and running as planned. Somewhere in the process I&#039;ve broken the light renderer though, so that needs some touching up. Then I&#039;ll just need to store some new info in the level text file, and I&#039;ll be able to leave the level editor and get back to the actual game. When we get to that point I&#039;ll give a slightly more in depth report on what I&#039;ve actually been trying to accomplish here <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141225201522im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0">

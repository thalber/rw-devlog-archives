Hi everyone! I&#039;m up and at it again!<br><br>@cwearly1, woooooooow&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141222121503im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/shocked.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0"> Thanks so much for the awesome work! That wiki is looking ace! I hope we&#039;ll be able to provide you with some more content to fill it with soon, hehe!<br><br>@tortoiseandcrow, yes, I agree very much on this. In the version from which the screenshot is taken, 3 layers of depth were allowed to render in front of the water, since then I&#039;ve changed it to only 1, getting rid of most of the plants that show up in front of stuff. Other than that it&#039;s just about messing with the level renderer until the RNG decides to not place any plants in the first layer. When it comes to the brown color, that&#039;s because there&#039;s some light down there ~ we&#039;ve talked about this and when we pass over the rooms again we&#039;ll make sure to get rid of that, but there&#039;s a lot of rooms so stuff end up lagging behind. But yeah, the idea is that it should be very dark down there, to further create the impression of a cross section rather than water being held in by a magic wall.<br><br>This <i>is </i>a very awkward situation graphically, as it&#039;s a prime example of 2D/3D colliding and not making sense together. But as I think James have mentioned this &quot;water contained behind terrain&quot; thing is going to be pretty much exclusive to this area, so we basically only have these 20 something rooms to handle making me think that we can try to mess around with the level renderer to solve the individual cases rather than try to come up with some huge universal solution.

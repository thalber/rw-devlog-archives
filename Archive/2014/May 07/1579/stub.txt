No, I&#039;m actually not raymarching, as I don&#039;t do any step-by-step checking of different depths. Instead the procedure has only two steps:<br><br>1. Check the pixel and get its info, which is color info but also depth (already encoded by the level editor).<br><br>2. Use the depth to check for where in the grab texture to look for objects that shadow this pixel. The greater the depth, the more up/left we check.<br><br>Effect: If you are in front of a wall, there will be a shadow on the wall. The further back the wall is, the further down/right the shadow will appear.<br><br>Your pseudo code is super helpful, by reading it I see a lot of things I can optimize in my shader! It&#039;s impressive that you manage to keep away from if-statements like that!<br><br>My texture looks like this:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229083417im_/http://oi61.tinypic.com/sqqezr.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br><br>So that&#039;s the same basic idea, right?

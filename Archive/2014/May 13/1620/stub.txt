<b>Update 137</b><br>Ughhhh a bad day. There will be a few of those too. The good news is that I have the framework for a separate graphics module up, and that I&#039;ve started implementing a tail. The bad news is that I&#039;ve spend the whole long day trying to keep the nodes of the tail out of the level geometry, and still haven&#039;t gotten it to work. <br><br>For the cosmetic body parts, I don&#039;t want the physics to be <i>too </i>good - if I do it like I do the physics for actual objects, they won&#039;t ever be able to pass through geometry and you might end up with part of your tail on the other side of a wall. Instead I want them to just be pushed out of geometry in a somewhat reasonable direction, without jumping around like crazy and without entering geometry unnecessarily. That&#039;s harder than it sounds. If the geometry was all circles it would be super easy - I have a go-to solution which is just pushing the nodes apart according to their radii. But the level geometry is compromised of squares, and I can&#039;t translate the algorithm in any reasonable way.<br><br>The only comfort to be found in this is that when I solve it, I&#039;ll be able to use that solution for all body part - slugcat hands, lizard tails, fly wings, etc. Stay tuned!<br><br>Edit: Wooho I solved it! Never underestimate the power of going online and whining to strangers, it obviously helped this time. Tomorrow: less hopeless news!

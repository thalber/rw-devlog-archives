Haha yeah - I think it&#039;ll be pretty cool when you&#039;ve been antagonized by those guys for a while to suddenly see them flee from either yourself when you&#039;ve managed to hurt a few of them with a spear, or some larger creature hunting them.<br><br><b>Update 311</b><br>Spent the day cleaning up the fleeing behavior - I had stupidly been using just 2D coordinates throughout the entire system, making it unable to differentiate between rooms and making creatures potentially confused by threats in other rooms. Now it&#039;s using world coordinates, that have the room index specified.<br><br>Now the threat tracker can create a link to the creature tracker as well, which I didn&#039;t really have a framework for yesterday. This means that a creature can avoid another creature using its tracking data, and I can easily set up links like that when the AI is alerted that a new creature has been spotted. As the time since the threatening creature was seen increases, the threat will decrease accordingly, until it&#039;s forgotten altogether.<br><br>Also enabled fleeing between rooms. If a fleeing creature realizes that there&#039;s an exit with no threats blocking it, it might just leave.<br><br>Have a nice weekend!

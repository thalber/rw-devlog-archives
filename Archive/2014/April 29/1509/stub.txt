Great success! <br><br>Poking around in this code feels like being an epileptic hippo trying to build a card house in a china shop. I download a little sample and insert it. It doesn&#039;t work. I try to adapt it. It doesn&#039;t work. Three hours later I manage to make it do anything that&#039;s not just an error message. <br><br>Then I try to change something - that&#039;s the way I prefer to learn. I switch a number for something else, try to bypass the code and output a plain color, something like that. This is where the china shop hippo comes in - <i>everything </i>I change <i>always </i>make the thing spit out error messages and fail.<br><br>Contrary to everything I know about code, you can make it crash without changing logic, but just by changing numbers. What&#039;ll happen if I go through this loop a couple more times? It&#039;ll crash! What will happen if I just add 4 to this value? It&#039;ll crash! In one of the few applicable examples of a 2d pixel shader I painstakingly found, there&#039;s a for-loop that executes three times. <br><br><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code">&nbsp; &nbsp; float remaining=1.0f;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; float coef=1.0;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; float fI=0;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; for (int j = 0; j &lt; 3; j++) {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>fI++;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>coef*=0.32;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>texcol += tex2D(_MainTex, float2(i.uv.x, i.uv.y - fI * _BlurAmount)) * coef;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>texcol += tex2D(_MainTex, float2(i.uv.x - fI * _BlurAmount, i.uv.y)) * coef;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>texcol += tex2D(_MainTex, float2(i.uv.x + fI * _BlurAmount, i.uv.y)) * coef;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>texcol += tex2D(_MainTex, float2(i.uv.x, i.uv.y + fI * _BlurAmount)) * coef;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>//texcol += tex2D(_MainTex, float2(i.uv.x, i.uv.y)) * coef;<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>remaining-=4*coef;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; }<br></div><br>It throws error messages and won&#039;t execute. If you change it to execute 2 times, it&#039;ll run. You see that line that&#039;s commented out? If you run that one istead of the one above it, the shader will run. Both those solutions are working! And both of them are super random! <br><br>I haven&#039;t felt this clueless in a long time. There doesn&#039;t really seem to be any complete documentation either haha.<br><br>I&#039;ll take a look at Gimym JIMBERT&#039;s tutorials next, maybe I just need to soak up an hour or two more of video before I&#039;m ready!

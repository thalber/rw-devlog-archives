Thanks to Gimym JIMBERT, as always! In one place I made a division with a counter that could, at times, be 0. Contrary to throwing an error, as I&#039;m used to from director, it set the value to NaN. In this case that value was the vertical velocity, which was then applied to the vertical position, and then at the end of the frame when it wanted to check terrain collision it had to loop through all the tiles from negative infinity to where the object was at, and that&#039;s the infinite loop.

The current task - if having moved into a dead end, the lizard should start moving backwards, and continue moving backwards through bends and corners until it reaches an intersection and can pick another direction. Proved to be somewhat tricky, but I have a few ideas!

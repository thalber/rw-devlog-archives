the thing that was posted was WAAAAY old (like, years) and wouldnt be any sort of representation. even the builds we&#039;re showing at PAX and such are 6-7 months old at this point and in a completely other programming language! a lot has changed, so let us get rain world to a point where we are proud to show it!

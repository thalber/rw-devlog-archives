Thanks! So yeah, it&#039;s as we suspected then. I&#039;ll just try to keep everything in the same atlas, and there shouldn&#039;t be a problem <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150102091221im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0"><br><br>Also, I found out how to do &quot;layers&quot; in Futile, they&#039;re called &quot;containers&quot; and seem really great! From how I understand it they resemble movieClips in flash, in that they&#039;re basically a sprite that has other sprites drawn inside it, and if you move or rotate the container every sprite in the container moves and rotates with it. Hopefully you can do other fun stuff too, such as color tweaking an entire container or the like. I assume that you can nest containers as well - if that&#039;s the case I have a truly awesome tool for keeping everything sorted and tidy and in the right z-order, without even having to use sortZ <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150102091221im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/grin.gif" alt="Grin" border="0">

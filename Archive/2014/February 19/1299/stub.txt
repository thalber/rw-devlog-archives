Cool! Actually the game only has a megabyte or two worth of graphics, because it&#039;s almost only low-res 1-bit stuff, and the majority of the animation is done by code rather than by having huge sprite sheets. The largest animation image data wise is probably the player legs&#039; running animation which would fit in, like, a 150*40 pixels sprite sheet. Where all the content is is in the levels, and they are loaded from external files. I think texture packer is accessible from code, so ideally I could use that and end up with one atlas for the level, and one for everything else. So no problem there :D<br><br>A problem that might be more pressing - in Rain World, I use two things that I haven&#039;t been able to find in Futile - Bézier curves and &quot;quads&quot; as they&#039;re called in Director. A &quot;quad&quot; is a sprite that&#039;s transformed to fit in a shape defined by 4 arbitrary positions, one for each corner. The &quot;quad&quot; I think there&#039;s hope for, with Unity being 3D at its core and all, but Bézier looks worse from what I&#039;ve been able to research. I&#039;m super terrible at reddit though, so what do I know :S<br><br>In the end I guess it can&#039;t be impossible to get Bézier curves into Futile, or use some type of extra plugin. Worst case scenario someone could perhaps be hired to do it (Actually having money is such a surreal feeling).

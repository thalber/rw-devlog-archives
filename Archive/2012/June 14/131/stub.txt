<b>Update 58</b><br>Gave the croc teeth and eyes. Also started to do the pixel animation for its arms, but there was a bit of lag in photoshop causing me to rage quit before I was done. Once I&#039;ve restarted the computer it&#039;ll go away and I can finish it, but there&#039;s an &quot;important update&quot; looming, making me unwilling to go through that process.<br><br>Those updates are <i>never</i> important, are they? The fact that you can&#039;t postpone it indefinitely is extemely irritating, and that once you&#039;ve postponed it an unknown number of times it just suddenly shuts down you computer makes me commit horrible acts of violence towards everyday objects in my surroundings. Now that I&#039;ve already derailed I want to say that I think the main problem with Microsoft products aren&#039;t that they&#039;re <i>bad</i>, it&#039;s that they&#039;re <i>irritating.</i> Msn messenger popping up from minimized mode every time you put the computer to sleep, the &quot;important updates&quot;, IE moving the cursor from the adress field to the page halfway through a word, &quot;checking for solutions&quot; even though obviously nothing at all is happening, and so on and so on... The stuff <i>works</i>, but by little means it&#039;s making you slowly drift towards insanity.

Yeah, sorry, I should&#039;ve said something about that... The way the game will be colored will be somewhat unconventional, but worry not, I do have a plan! Once I&#039;ve been able to produce a screenshot, or at least a mock-up, I&#039;ll do the concept / art style reveal and things will start to make more sense. Or they probably won&#039;t, but there will at least be some cohesion to the insanity!

<b>Update 26</b><br>I worked on the art today. Still don&#039;t have anything I want to show you, but I&#039;m getting there. It&#039;s a lot of fun to work with the voxels, any three dimensional shape I can imagine I can create, and see with (decently) correct shadows. <br><br>I&#039;ve been working on a system for palettes. Basically the goal is to convey both light and distance using as few colors as possible, which is not as easy as you might think, especially if you want to make the depth of the graphics justice. <br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129232222im_/http://oi40.tinypic.com/fwk4zr.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br><br>The reason I want to have few, flat colors is because a level will be pasted together from hundreds of graphical elements. By greatly restricting the palettte like this I achieve three things: <br>1) Some visual harmony, with many many colors it would hurt your eyes<br>2) Color will mainly be conveying level information, decoration is its second purpose. For the sake of conveiance three colors is actually enough (Look at the level editor), so ending up at 15 colors would be hard to motivate<br>3) Maybe most importantly, flat patches of color blend together. If everything has its own color every splice between graphical elements would be visible. If there are fewer colors, however, there&#039;s a much greater chance that two neighbouring fields will have the same color, making the joints invisible.<br><br>Right now I&#039;m at 8 colors, a number I&#039;d like to reduce to 5.

I know this is getting crazy, and I <i>will </i>get back to work sooner rather than later. It&#039;s just that after having spent several hours each day doing this without even thinking much about it the sudden contrast of not spending that amount of time sitting around trying to convince a lizard to crawl in some specific way was kind of pleasant for a change. <br><br>I&#039;m alive, and I&#039;ll get back to work soon. The game only has its final 20% left, meaning that we&#039;re at least 25% through development!

Yeah, I was thinking along those lines... Well, as I always say, we&#039;ll see where it ends up <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141212170251im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0"><br><br><b>Update 42</b><br>Today I did a (preliminary?) visual representation for the short cut entrances. They&#039;re still impossible to spot, but it took me like an hour to draw so I&#039;m not doing it all over again until I know what they&#039;re finally going to look like. At least it&#039;s theoretically possible to spot them now!<br><br>I&#039;ve started to make a few levels as well. The alpha needs levels of great variety, because I&#039;ll need to know what kind of levels you guys think works best.<br><br>Apart from all this stuff there has been a change to the gameplay mechanics. Instead of consuming the flies on touch like mario coins (or pac-man pellets) the bear cathes them in its hands. You then have to get away and sit still for a short moment in order to eat them. It&#039;s very quick, and hopefully won&#039;t try your patience too much, but I felt it needed to go in the game. As it was, because of flies gathering together, you could suddenly get something like five kills in a second by just jumping through a swarm, and then continue for a minute without getting anything. This evens things out a little, as you can&#039;t catch more than two at a time. <br><br>Also I think it fits better with the game&#039;s style, the lizard doesn&#039;t eat you on touch but rather carries you back to its hole, and I wanted the player to do something similar. I didn&#039;t want you to eat while chased. Instead you have to hunt, then escape and find a safe spot where you can quickly munch down what you caught before getting out there again. Another benefit is that sometimes the game would have small moments of dead time, when you where just ducking in cover and waiting for a croc to pass by. Now those moments have a purpose, and you can get better at trying to time them and get them to work with your hunting-escaping scheme.<br><br>It&#039;s all either not animated or horribly animated at this point of course, but the mechanics are in. The game eventually will have a bit of an animation overhaul, for example the vertical pole climbing looks unacceptable at this point. Maybe I&#039;ll get to this at the same time I give the croc its legs.

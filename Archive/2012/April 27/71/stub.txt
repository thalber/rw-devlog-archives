Thanks! Your anticipation is turned straigh into motivation!<br><br><b>Update 36</b><br>Light editor more or less done, which means that all the planned editors are at least started on. All of them need som adjustments, though. <br><br>The image shows the light editor UI, the light being raytraced, and finally a level being rendered with the light applied.<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170608092325im_/http://oi48.tinypic.com/kd7ku8.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br><br>In the light editor you should also be able to control the angle of the light.<br><br>My tiles are drawn with a top-left highlight. I was thinking about what to do when the light is coming in from the right, and think I have settled on a kind of weird approach. In the end it&#039;ll be easier for me, I think, to just flip the entire level, render it, and then flip it back, than to try to mess with all the individual tiles. This feels unintuitive, perhaps because a non-substancial thing(the light) is allowed to affect a substancial thing (the entire level), but this is programming and weird-feeling solutions are as good as any, if they work.<br><br>On another note I&#039;ve been starting to touch upon a framework that will allow for some color in the levels. I don&#039;t know if I even want it though, will have to test and see.<br><br>Made a horrible little mock-up of some grass, through the effects editor. The fading density looked nice!

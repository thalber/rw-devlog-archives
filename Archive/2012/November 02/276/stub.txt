Oh! Almost forgot about that! Don&#039;t worry though, the game is already pretty playable, so I&#039;ll have something for you guys!<br><br><b>Update 111</b><br>Let me take a moment to tell the story of how to add a graphical asset to Rain World.<br><br>Let&#039;s pose the example that I&#039;d like to put in a machine looking something like this:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141225223743im_/http://oi50.tinypic.com/24xf72p.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Here any sane artist would just open a graphics software and happily go at it.

I guess that the good part is that I then can use that same machine part again, but that hasn&#039;t really started to pay off yet...

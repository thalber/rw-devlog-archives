Hehe thanks for making me look like less of a *forever alone* &nbsp;<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141214231912im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/grin.gif" alt="Grin" border="0"><br>You didn&#039;t like the corridors? Seems everyone liked different aspects... it&#039;ll be hard to find common points in this feedback. I&#039;ll get to it, though! If you feel your feedback has not been considered, don&#039;t worry, it&#039;ll kick in for real once I get to designing the levels. Hopefully I&#039;ll be able to do a post where I summarize the feedback and describe what it made me change, so you really feel that your input made a difference.<br><br><b>Update 52</b><br>Do you remember the light raytracing? I came up with a new way to do it, and it baffles me that I didn&#039;t think of this before. To put it simply; imagine that instead of going through every single pixel and trace a ray from that pixel through every single layer to see where it hits, you use a bitmap. The bitmap is white in the places where there is light and black where there&#039;s shadow. It repeats through <i>all </i>the layers <i>once</i>. When arriving to a new layer it applies the &quot;shadow image&quot; to that layer, and then <i>adds that layer&#039;s contour to the shadow image</i>. This means that when the next layer is supposed to get its share of light, the pixels that were blocked by the previous layer are blacked out, creating a shadow. As it proceeds through the 20 layers the shadow image gets more shadow and less light, as the different surfaces absorb the light.<br><br>The effect of this is, sadly, almost exactly the same as the previous system. The difference is that it takes like 15 seconds to render instead of 7 minutes. You don&#039;t really care about this progess I guess, but it has implications. Being able to more swiftly regenerate or make changes to a level will make the levels better, because it&#039;ll feel worth it to regenerate a level even because of smaller flaws.

HAHAHA! That&#039;s amazing, I never thought of it, but when you say it it&#039;s so clear! Yeah, the game will basically play like pac-man! Maybe with the difference that in pac-man the ghosts are always aware of where you are, here there&#039;ll be more focus on sneaking. I think pac-man is a great game though, it&#039;s a simple and very self-contained design, so I don&#039;t mind at all! <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20200806102130im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0"><br><br><b>Update 41</b><br><br>Started to clean some stuff up as a first step towards the alpha version. Implemented death by falling, both for Bears and Crocs. <br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20200806102130im_/http://oi46.tinypic.com/2lc4rux.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br><br>In a level like this the crocs will quite often end up fighting out above the open air, and end up falling. I made it so that if a single croc catches the player when climbing on the beams it doesn&#039;t shake him like it usually does, but when two of them are out there fighting there&#039;s really no keeping them from tumbling to their death.<br><br>In this level one interesting thing happened. You see the little left-facing dead end at the very bottom of the structure? That&#039;s a shortcut that leads to the upper-left island, through that ugly pipe-thingy sticking out to the left.<br><br>The blue lizard is a wall climber. When the red lizard caught me he was seen by the blue one, and the blue one started chasing him. He tried to take the route through the short cut, but the blue lizard actually didn&#039;t follow him, but rather climbed up to the exit he was going to appear out of, intercepting him and snatching the poor bear.<br><br>This shows the pros and cons of the shortcuts, through them you can quickly escape a site, but you&#039;re suddenly very predictable. Everything moves with the same speed in the shortcuts, and you always reach the same destination.<br><br>

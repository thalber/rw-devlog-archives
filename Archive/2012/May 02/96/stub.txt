Haha it&#039;s funny that you say it&#039;s dark and creepy, because I actually didn&#039;t have that in mind. I just thought that it&#039;d be reasonable for creatures of the same size to fight over their prey, and things ended up moving like this because of a combination of technical stuff and art choices. When I looked at the video again though, I totally saw what you mean o.0 They&#039;re ripping the little guy apart!&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20200806102130im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/shocked.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0"><br><br>I&#039;m usually hesistant to talk about art stuff (if it can be said with words, why the art?) but I guess I should explain what&#039;s going on here. I&#039;m not making a horror game, but I&#039;m trying to portray a world that is very harsh, and where survival has to be fought for. There is a twist though, that instead of realistic harshness I want it to be harsh, but in a slightly twisted, cartoony way. <br><br>Weird little creatures that you don&#039;t really know what&#039;s going on in their heads fit the game medium, because things will inevitably move a little jerky, behave a little uncanny. Better to play with this than fight against it.<br><br>Rain World is not a horror game, there won&#039;t be excessive amounts of blood or violence for the sake of it. I will however do my best to convey a very different world, where strange creatures live and hunt, and if aspects of this are creepy, I&#039;ll go with that. <br><br>So, to actually provide an answer, I won&#039;t try to make the game creepy, but there&#039;ll be more of this. If you find this creepy, I hope you&#039;ll find the final thing even creepier!

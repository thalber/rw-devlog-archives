Oh, that&#039;s a problem. I need to think about the name then!<br><br>I&#039;ll leave you for a week. I need to concentrate on a deadline for school, and the only way is to completely purge my mind of this project. <br><br>Here&#039;s a farewell gift though, a makabre little application in wich you can watch the crocs eat two dead bears. The sound is stripped away as I don&#039;t have anything I&#039;m happy with yet, but you&#039;ll at least get an idea about what stuff looks like at this point.<br><br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200806012324/https://dl.dropbox.com/u/50146906/lizards.zip" target="_blank"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20200806012324im_/http://oi48.tinypic.com/idvjg0.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a><br><br>See you in a week!

<b>Update 20</b><br><br>Almost no progress what so ever... It turns out my code for raytracing the vision of the camera doesn&#039;t actually work. However something else (still unknown what) was obviously broken in a matching way, so the code gave me the right output anyway... Fine, up until I need to fix a problem and really have to understand the code. Then I realize it shouldn&#039;t work, but it <i>kind of</i> does, except from that problem I was trying to fix. If I fix the code so that it <i>should </i>work it doesn&#039;t work at all. So I settled for the broken code, with a dirty feeling of not having actually solved the problem.<br><br>With a horrible hack I managed to make it so that platforms are at least shaded on the underside. This is what it looks like now, with a thousand flake-thingies suspended in mid air to test the shadows.<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129232222im_/http://oi40.tinypic.com/2ynnzhu.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br><br>There are some horrible bugs in there but hopefully it&#039;s mostly me who can see them. Right now - bye bye shadow code for a while, I&#039;m painfully tired of this...<br><br>Tomorrow I will do something else.

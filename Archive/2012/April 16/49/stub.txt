<b>Update 24</b><br>I&#039;m alive and stuff is happening. The stuff that&#039;s happening is mainly level editor stuff though, and I don&#039;t really have anything to show you. Personally I find user interfaces the most hard/boring thing to do, and it&#039;s a lot of that going on in the level editor. The user interface is going to suck, but I don&#039;t mind too much as I don&#039;t really think of the level editor as an official part of the game. <br><br>It&#039;s also important to me that the level editor I release is the same as the one <i>I</i> use to make the built-in levels, I don&#039;t like the dummed down level editors that are included in some games where it&#039;s obvious that the developers had access too a much wider variety of tools. So, in conclusion, the level editor is becoming ugly and hard to use, but it&#039;s more of a development tool that I&#039;ll also let you guys play with than an actual part of the game. I might include some kind of little tutorial on how to use it, though.<br><br>In other level editor news the tile editor is up and running, even more so than before. It works, it displays little previews, it&#039;s fairly fast and easy to use and it doesn&#039;t have any tile sets to work with yet. Still, the boring technical parts are more or less done by now. <br><br>Damn, it seems the level editor is the new croc path finding... Well, if I&#039;m ever going to arrive to the point where this dev log is going to flood with juicy images there needs to be a level editor to generate those images, so it&#039;s all good I guess.<br><br>Over and out!

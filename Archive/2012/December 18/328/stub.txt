It&#039;s such a crazy cool concept and it really shows what goes into the production side of a game when you produce and design at the same time. Just reading this has probably made me a better game designer and I can only hope that eventually I&#039;m as good at figuring out issues and coding as you are. Haha. With my project I want to do something like you are doing (as far as documentation), but with design (I don&#039;t plan on producing anything for a little while).<br><br>Regardless, I&#039;m excited to play this game whenever it comes out!<br></div>Thank you! From here my development process seems like the most amateurish thing ever, but I guess I&#039;m good at covering that up then haha! You write that you don&#039;t plan to start working on anything right now ~ if I could give you a tip I&#039;d say this: Don&#039;t wait in order to create a huge project, stuff like that are probable to die in pre-production if you&#039;re a lone developer. When working alone it&#039;s better to just get started with a small project, because the only way to learn is to do. If you&#039;re a hobbyist like me the keyword would be <i>small </i>project, as everything takes (no joke) about 50 times as long as you think. Rain World was supposed to be a two week project. Right now It&#039;s been in development for 1.5 years, and is still most likely nowhere close to finished...<br><br><b>Update 125</b><br>A little menu stuff. Started touching upon saving and loading single player games.

<b>Update 85</b><br>Hi! Sorry it&#039;s been a while - real life stuff has been occupying me, but I&#039;ve also been able to do a little Rain World work. Here&#039;s a screenshot:<br><br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141219150456/http://oi47.tinypic.com/vymo5.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141219150456im_/http://oi47.tinypic.com/vymo5.jpg" alt="" width="270" height="200" border="0"></a><br><br>This level contains some custom graphical assets - for example the machine the player is standing on is drawn explicitly for this purpose. The idea is that if I want to use something like this in another level as well that&#039;s allowed, and this way the library of graphical assets will grow and make the levels more and more diverse.<br><br>As the levels can be loaded and manipulated I can go back to levels I&#039;ve already done and add in new assets as they are made.<br><br>James has been doing some cool stuff on his side, even though it was some time since I heard from him... How&#039;s it going, James?<br><br>The world is starting to take shape, and for example the above screenshot is from an actual area in the game. This means I&#039;m a little more hesistant to show everything I do at this point, as I don&#039;t want to give too much away. Hopefully I&#039;ll manage to find a balance between keeping the devlog interesting and still making the final release exciting with a lot of stuff that hasn&#039;t been seen before.<br><br>

<b>Update 37, continuation</b><br><br>Made the renderer support two effect colors.<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170608092325im_/http://oi46.tinypic.com/257q1w9.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Right now my intention is to cap it at two colors, both beacuse it&#039;s a hassle to add multiple gradient masks for every layer and every color, and also because it&#039;s stylish.<br><br>I am very much aware of how aful that sorry excuse for grass looks, and that it doesn&#039;t even grow on the slopes. Be assured that I&#039;ll get to this, right now I&#039;m just trying to set up the color system. In other words, progress is still technical rather than art-oriented, even though I&#039;m thinking about the art more now than ever. It&#039;s still hard to say how much like the above screenshots it&#039;ll look or how far it&#039;ll stray. I think, however, that I&#039;ve found a technical approach that produces something I like, and I&#039;m happy about that. Even though a level takes a solid 7 minutes or so to render -.-<br><br>Despite promises made I for some reason settled for the same old top-left lightsource.

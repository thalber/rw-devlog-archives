<b>Update 38</b><br>Made a quick concept art, and put it in the main post together with some text that&#039;s more up to date.<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170608092325im_/http://oi50.tinypic.com/244yyz7.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Haha I actually think the actual game produces better looking stuff than this concept art, which is the wrong way around I guess, but many things are with this project!<br><br>The art doesn&#039;t really give away anything you didn&#039;t know already, I figure. The current title is &quot;Rain World&quot;, and it&#039;s set in a very rained down place. Do you remember when I said that the game will be about hunting as much as possible in a limited amount of time? The premise is that the player creature can not survive the rainfall, and has to come out to hunt on the rare, short occasions when the sky is dry.

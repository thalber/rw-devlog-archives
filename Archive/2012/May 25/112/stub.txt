<b>I&#039;m alive!</b><br>They told me I&#039;ll likely have to complement my thesis later though, so this beast is merely fended off, not slain.<br><br>Has been really interesting to recieve the comments from the alpha testers! The opinions have been incredibly diverse... The levels that are some peoples&#039; favourites are hated by others, someone writes that wall jumping is the biggest flaw in the game, someone says it&#039;s their preferred aspect... There are some glitches that everyone seems agreed on, but other than that people are pretty much all over the place. The game seems to be a tad too difficult though, which isn&#039;t surprising as this difficulty is what I imagined for the final levels, while you guys have been thrown straight into it. I&#039;ll sit down and try to make sense of it soon, and maybe post a list of what I&#039;ll change because of the feedback.<br><br>Thank you!<br><br><b>Update 45</b><br>The croc is getting feet! It looks weird and unfinished still, but it&#039;s on its way. Even at this stage the poor creature consists of no less than 13 sprites, and that&#039;s going to increase quite a lot more...

Thanks! I will!<br><br><b>Update 75</b><br>Earlier I&#039;ve started to do some sound implementation, today I continued with that. Sound is really my weakest spot, and it takes a lot of trial and error to get stuff to work out.<br><br>It&#039;s been a while, so here&#039;s a screenshot of what the game looks like right now:<br><br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200806012324/http://oi45.tinypic.com/33ok0m9.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20200806012324im_/http://oi45.tinypic.com/33ok0m9.jpg" alt="" width="270" height="200" border="0"></a><br><br>This level is called &quot;shooting range&quot;, the flies keep to the middle and you get them by throwing stuff at them from the balconies. You see the little black things on the lower platforms? Those are &quot;pebbles&quot;(actually their graphics are most often representing different kinds of scrap metal and machine parts). When you get close to them they blink a little, so you can see them.<br><br>Right now throwing stuff when climbing on a vertical pole makes you lose your grip, I guess I should attend to that.

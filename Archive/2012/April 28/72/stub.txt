Just wanted to share this most recent output of my level renderer:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170608092325im_/http://oi45.tinypic.com/14udwyq.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br><br>This is just place holder plants, place holder colors, place holder everything, but I was surprised by how much I liked the look of this coloring method. It created just the sort of washed-out colors I wanted, the colors of a place tormented by decades of heavy rain.

Thank you!&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141223132645im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/grin.gif" alt="Grin" border="0"> I&#039;m most honored!<br>The irony of this is that your first interaction with this thread led to - the postponing of update 100 hahaha! I had planned to do a regular &quot;Did some level design&quot; post, but if there&#039;s expectations to meet I&#039;ll have to be able to give you at least something, and thus, we wait.<br>Don&#039;t be discouraged though, keep interacting! <br><br><b>Update 99.5</b><br>James sent me some rain sounds, and boy, did the scare the crap out of me! There are a few versions to pick from, and they all sound like different circles in rain hell. Suddenly I feel unsure whether my graphics can do justice to this when it comes to metal and stone being melted, pounded and disintegrated to nothingness. I&#039;ll have to look over my filters...

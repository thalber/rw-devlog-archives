Haha I should look that up!<br><br><b>Update 115</b><br>Worked some one the &quot;rules&quot; of the game, like how it handles the game aspects of what&#039;s going on. I&#039;ve got it to a point I&#039;m decently happy with.<br><br>If one player dies the other one is given just enough time to get back to a hole. This means that you <i>can </i>win even if you die, because if you had more flies than your opponent and he/she doesn&#039;t reach their hole in time, you still have the victory. It&#039;s however still a pretty huge advandage to not be the one to die first.<br><br>If one player is dead, the game is halted immediately as the other player goes into a hole, and you don&#039;t have to wait for the rain.<br><br>If both players go back into their holes at the same time the game is ended. I might change the requirements so that at least one player has to be dead for the game to end - sometimes you go into holes in order to escape lizards as well.<br><br>When the rain comes all players that are outside are counted as dead - those in holes as alive.<br><br>I still have to make it so that the game stops if one player is already in a hole and the other one dies.<br><br><br>On top of this I added a fun little detail - in competitive game modes a player can&#039;t go into a hole that&#039;s already occupied, you&#039;re spitted straight out again. I hope this will create some fun and frantic situations when players race for the closest hole. Some levels might even have less holes than players, then the gameplay becomes a balance of trying to hunt effectively and staying closer to the hole than your opponent.

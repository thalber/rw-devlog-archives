<b>Update 23</b><br>Now there is a tile editor, though there are no tile sets. The level editor will work like this:<br><br>First, there will be the level editor. Here, two players can work at the same level simultaneously and create the layout of the level. You&#039;ll be able to save the level in som kind of test version, with no real graphics, just to try it out and make adjustments. Once you&#039;re happy with the geometrics you move on to the graphics phase.<br><br>In the tile editor, you can place objects that correspond to the level you&#039;ve already made. Here I think it&#039;s going to switch to mouse control, it would be too tedious otherwise. So you look at your level and place tiles, but you&#039;re only editing the appearance of the level, it will still function exactly like it did when you tested it. Right now you can decide if a tile will be smooth concrete or rough rock, but there&#039;ll be much more to that as I start to produce some actual graphics.<br><br>Then there&#039;s the effects editor. Here you add plants and the like, it&#039;ll make sense to you when you see it (or I describe it in more detail later). Essentially it&#039;ll be stuff that grows on/hangs from/is applied to the tiles you&#039;ve placed earlier.<br><br>After the effects are applied you&#039;ll move on to the exciting procedure of staring at light being raytraced for two minutes.<br><br>Finally the level is rendered and can be saved.<br><br>With the art editor I&#039;m struggling with a balance, on one hand I want the editor to be free enough to make the level look like you want it, on the other hand I want it to be somewhat constrained. This is because not all people are artists, and you should be able to make a level that looks better than you would&#039;ve been able to draw free-hand. Also I don&#039;t want you to be able to make a level that strays too far from the game&#039;s general art direction. We&#039;ll see where on this scale of freedom/constraint it finally ends up.

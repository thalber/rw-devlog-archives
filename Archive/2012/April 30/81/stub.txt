I haven&#039;t really decided on what kills the creature, if it&#039;s unable to breath if wet, or the slightly more over-the-top idea that the rain can actually pound a small animal to death... Maybe I won&#039;t have to specify.<br><br><b>Update 39</b><br>Today I did a little work on the level editor. Not the level renderer, but the editor! Created a function that you can set up an axis for horizontal mirroring of your actions, which makes it considerably easier to paint a symmetrical level. <br><br>I made a level, which will be the first or the second one in the campaign. I also started to think about how the campaign will be set up, and how the format of the levels will look like.<br><br>I use the word &quot;campaign&quot; here instead of &quot;single player game&quot;, because I have no intention of stopping two or more players from going through the campaign together. Maybe you&#039;ll have to be alone to progress and unlock new levels though, we&#039;ll see how hard it is to balance.<br><br>And, I made an important decision. From now on I&#039;ll stop working on random art assets, as I can&#039;t really motivate this by having to test the tile renderer any more. I got stuck in a pattern where I drew a lot of random tiles, thinking that I&#039;d probably need them when creating levels later. This is a horribly unefficient method, as I in the end would likely have ended up with a lot of art assets that were never used.<br><br>The new approach is this; I create levels, and then I create the art assets needed for them. This will give me a slowly increasing library of tiles, and I will probably often find that the levels are faster and faster to make, as I can reuse old tiles. If <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200806102130/https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution" target="_blank">art evolution</a> occurs I can always go back to old levels and mix in some newer tiles to create consistency.<br><br>My thoughts on the level editor has also changed slightly. I no longer view it as a game feature, but a development tool. A development tool that I plan to release, but still a development tool. The difference here is that I don&#039;t need to focus on making the level editor look all slick, which would be wasted time anyways since half of the audience won&#039;t even open it, and those that are interested in making their own levels are probably more towards the nerdy end, and won&#039;t mind a little programming grit. What I&#039;m saying is that I&#039;ll make the level editor mainly for myself to use, which means it&#039;s going to suck, but I still plan to release it. <br><br>In other other news I&#039;ve started to set up some stats for two different types of lizards, the easiest one and the hardest one. My idea right now is that there&#039;ll be five types, one being the easiest, three being about equal but in different ways, making them depend on different terrains, and one being the hardest. This one won&#039;t be better than the three specialized ones in their specialized stat, but will have a higher over-all performance and a very persistent hunting technique, making it a fearsome hunter.

<b>Update 83</b><br>Still no stable internet connection, but at least I can upload some pictures.<br>Most of my recent work has been on the editors:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141219150456im_/http://oi46.tinypic.com/18y71d.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Some of you probably recognize them, it&#039;s the level overview, the geometry editor, the tile editor and the effects editor. They are brushed up UI-wise, functions are added, projects can be saved and loaded, and the whole thing actually works as a stand-alone-application for the first time, as almost all the functions can be accessed through actual UI-solutions instead of by feeding lines into the debug code window.<br><br>Apart from this there has been a lot of small stuff in the actual game, which you never knew was missing but had to be added in. Such as up-pickable objects blinking when approaching them only if your hands aren&#039;t full, the ability to let go of flies in order to pick up spears, some work on the lizards, and so on and so on.<br><br>Art-wise there hasn&#039;t been a ton of progress, but at least some. For example these are in:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141219150456im_/http://oi45.tinypic.com/359fh1k.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br><br>The signs are randomly generated from a set of parts:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141219150456im_/http://oi47.tinypic.com/2afgb2o.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Long ago I promised that I wouldn&#039;t make graphics and then try to fit them into my levels, but instead make levels and then create graphics for them. This didn&#039;t happen, I&#039;m still making a lot of loose tiles. I&#039;ll try to shape up though. Now is the time to start actually building the world.

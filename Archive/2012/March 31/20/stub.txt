Thank you sir&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129224152im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/gentleman.gif" alt="Gentleman" border="0"><br><br><b>Update 7</b><br>Boring but important progress today: I managed to export a .png file.<br><br>This has implications though. If I would have to save the levels as text files I&#039;d only be able to save the geometry of the level, and all the graphics would have to be generated on start up. When you start the level you can&#039;t really tolerate more than 5 seconds for the level to be drawn, and this would mean a pretty simple layout.<br><br>If the level can be saved as an image file however, its graphics can be generated from the level editor. After you&#039;ve made an awsome level you can possibly endure to wait a minute or two for intricate stuff such as hundreds of grass straws and light and shadows to be rendered, to make it look extra juicy. <br><br>Being able to save levels as images enables me to make levels look much more complex. This stuff is far in the future, but it&#039;s nice to know as it helps me when thinking about the overall art direction for the game.

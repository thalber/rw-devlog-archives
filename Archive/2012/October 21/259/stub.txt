The only thing of significance to the curse seems to be if pixels are (255, 255, 255) white, treated as transparent by Director, or not. A black sillhoutte creates the same effect as the original image.<br><br>If flipped vertically or horizontally the effect presists. Same for 90 degree rotation. If the image is inverted (black-&gt;white/white-&gt;black) the effect goes away. <br><br>Removing all rows of pixels that are entirely white from left to right doesn&#039;t help. It&#039;s not about all-white columns top-down either. <br><br>Ladies and gents, I present to you a real cursed image:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141225144916im_/http://oi45.tinypic.com/2akjza9.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Displaying this specific combination of black and white screws Macromedia Director up terribly. Quite interesting, if it wasn&#039;t so irritating.<br><br>Tomorrow I move the image to one of my old game projects to see if it slows that one down as well.

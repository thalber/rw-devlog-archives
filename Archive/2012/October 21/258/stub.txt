<b>Update 103</b><br>Raaaaaargh!<br>Been wrestling an extremely annoying bug for a while now. <br><br>I have known for a long time that some levels, for some reason, lag horribly. It&#039;s not the things that are going on in the level, but drawing the actual picture. Now when I got one of those levels I decided to try to nail it down.<br><br>It seems like the problem was in the image that display the light on the backround layer. I have pinned it down to this:<br><br>If I color any vertical row of pixels further away from the left edge than 118 pixels (117 doesn&#039;t work) any other color than white, the lag dissapears. It&#039;s not a specific pixel that&#039;s causing trouble - when I go into this vertical pillar of colored pixels and remove sections the lag comes and goes completely randomly. There seems to be a pattern that if more colored pixels are removed, the lag is more likely to come back. However, removing the top half makes the lag come back just as much as removing the bottom half.<br><br>In addition to this, there seems to be different reactions depending on whether I do stuff from the code or from the console, and on top of that there seems to be different reactions depending on whether I re-color the pixels one at a time or with one single command.<br><br>It&#039;s possible to locate a loosely defined area in the image that causes the trouble. If these pixels are put in a sprite they can make any level lag, so it&#039;s obviously their fault. If you start to cut this area down though, all the lag will suddenly dissapear - it&#039;s not connected to specific pixels, but rather to a <i>combination </i>of pixels. I badly wanted it to be about some specific pixel, maybe one color that I could just remove or so, but it&#039;s not.<br><br>I think of it as a curse - certain orders of pixels are cursed.<br><br>Even if I re-draw a level on another random seed the curse persists, which could possibly mean that whatever pattern causes it is on a bigger scale, a similar general layout will always create a cursed image. This means that some levels I create can <i>never </i>work.<br><br>This stuff is obviously far beyond my level, and probably has something to do with how graphics are rendered. Sadly I&#039;ve seen the same problem on other computers as well ...<br><br>I have no idea what to do about this.

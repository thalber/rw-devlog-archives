A sketch I made, just playing around.<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129224152im_/http://oi43.tinypic.com/2eyvn6o.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Before you get excited/dissapointed, keep in mind that this is my very first pixels I ever draw for this game, it is much more likely that it will end up looking nothing like this than something like this. However, a first tiny step towards working on the visuals has been taken.<br><br>It&#039;s nice to have art in the dev log, now I might actually have read it myself!

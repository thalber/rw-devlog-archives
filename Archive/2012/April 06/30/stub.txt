<b>Update 14</b><br><br>It&#039;s becoming a game! All the creatures are in and behaving somewhat like what I want them to. I&#039;ve been thinking about about the game rules, here&#039;s what I came up with:<br><br>1. Catch as many A-creatures as possible within a limited time.<br>2. Survive! No respawns.<br><br>The idea is that I want a basic mechanic that&#039;s the same for a multi player game and a single player game. The &quot;high score&quot; of a level will be the amount of A-creatures eaten within a certain time, and you can attempt to break these records, for some single player replay value.<br><br>Multi player: There is a timer, urging players to hunt rather than just sitting around in some corner. When a player dies he is not respawned, but the timer is halved, so that you won&#039;t have to sit around inactive for ever and ever. The gameplay is less interesting for <i>all players</i> when one is dead, but the surviving players should be given just a little extra time to gain an advantage and compete among each other. The amount of time I&#039;m thinking about is two or three minutes, the multi player game mode should be fairly rapid-fire paced with new levels every so often. This is especially important as there are no respawns.<br><br>The players are ranked from how many A-creatures they managed to eat in their lifetime, but <i>a surviving player is always ranked above a dead one</i>. This means that there can be no situation where you benefit from committing suicide. If all players are dead the one with the most &quot;eats&quot; will be the match winner, but if there is one surviving player he will win, despite not having catched a thing. So, the priorities are: 1) Don&#039;t get eaten. 2) Eat as much as possible.<br><br>Single player: The basic mechanics are the same, but the winning condition for a single player level is 1) Being alive, 2) Having eaten a certain number of A-creatures. If you manage those the next level will unlock or however the campaign will be laid out. In the campaign there could also be levels where you&#039;re supposed to just get to an exit like any platformer, the high score of those will be how fast you got there.<br><br>Possibly there could be some kind of co-operative mode where two or more players play the single player campaign, and their score is added up and then divided by their numbers or something like that. We&#039;ll see what&#039;s reasonable.<br><br>I&#039;m currently setting this framework up, and will soon try it. Some (most) things might be revised.<br><br>Yesterday I saved a version of the game and tried on another computer, seemed to work fine. The import of text files and export of .png files worked too, which was a huge relief.<br><br>The level editor will probably save a level as an image file, which will contain the level image as well as the level data, the latter coded into a block of different-colored pixels which will look like noise to the human eye. This is probably not the optimal way to do things, but it compresses the entire level into one file, which is nice.

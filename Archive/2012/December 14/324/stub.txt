Keep on going! <br></div>Thank you for the kind words! Knowing that there&#039;s some anticipation out there certainly helps me catching my breath when it seems I&#039;m out of it.<br><br><b>Update 123</b><br>James got inspired from the new levels, and made new music! Two new tracks of the same high standard as always. These tracks are a bit more background-ish according to me, so I think I&#039;ll try to fit them into the hub world areas. They could also work as a suspenceful background for a level with many not-too-dangerous lizards where the action is kind of even in intesity.<br><br>On my end I&#039;ve been tampering a bit with the world map, and I also solved a problem where it would instantly transport you two rooms instead of just one upon entering a door. I went with an ugly solution, blocking the second of the double signals instead of finding the source for it and removing it. It&#039;s my game, I&#039;m the only programmer and I do what I want <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141227105920im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/evil.gif" alt="Evil" border="0">

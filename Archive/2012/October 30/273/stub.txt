Hehe no worries James, I loopified it myself - you&#039;ve heard the result. If you don&#039;t think it&#039;s good enough lemme know <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141225223743im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0"><br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141225223743/http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.msg809138#msg809138">Quote from: electrolyte on October 29, 2012, 03:05:24 AM</a></div><div class="quote">I just read one of your old posts and you mentioned Director, man that&#039;s awesome.

This is certainly the last thing I make in it, and probably the last thing that <i>gets made</i> with it as well. It&#039;s good to be using a software that creates applications that you can be kind of sure will be possible to use even in a few years. I guess I&#039;ll have to emulate windows xp if I wanna play Rain World in ten years haha!<br><br><br>Contrary to the idea I have but never live up to - to have fun and interesting posts high up on new pages to draw new readers in - I will give you a dead boring update today. I know myself from following devlogs that boring updates are at least less frustrating than several days with no updates at all. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141225223743/http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/" target="_blank">Hrm</a>. So here you go:<br><br><b>Update 109</b><br>Made a system that enables player entrances to be shut off. As those of you who have been reading this somewhat regularly might know the game will contain levels that can both be reachable from an open world and opened up through a custom game kind of setup. In the open world scenario I want them to have only one entrance, while in a custom game I might want to have one entrance for every player or something like that.<br><br>So now I can create a level with as many entrances as I want, and then shut all but one of them down from the code when loading them in the campaign. I simply make them lizard dens, because as it stands that was a good quick fix - a player entering a lizard den will be spitted out again right away. Had to make them not be counted when the lizards try to decide where to emerge, so that the same lizards will still come out of the same holes. It seems to work ok!<br><br>

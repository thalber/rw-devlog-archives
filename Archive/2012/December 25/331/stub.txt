No worries! I&#039;ve made a few games, so I know the feeling of a 2 week or 1 month project becoming a several year thing. I also have a fairly large support group behind me for games (college for game design!) xD I&#039;m excited to see where your project ends up though. You seem like you are nearing &quot;completion&quot;. ;P<br></div>Oh, you&#039;re in game college! o.0 Then I should obviously be on the recieving end of any exchange of advice haha! Maybe in my situation I shouldn&#039;t look at the gradual growth and feature creep as something bad, when doing this alone as a hobby maybe one could as well embrace the fact that there&#039;s no fixed deadline. I mean, there are a lot of people who have to cut in their projects in order to meet a deadline, and I don&#039;t. Plus, many indie game classics such as Cave Story seems to be the product of a fairly uncoordinated growth of a project.<br><br>Now of course I&#039;m not alone any more, as I have James on board and he as well have hopes and expectations for this project. So I have to keep my s**t together to at least some degree! However, I&#039;ll of course take this:<br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141227105920/http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.msg830023#msg830023">Quote from: jamesprimate on December 18, 2012, 09:16:07 PM</a></div><div class="quote">personally, im psyched that the development is getting extended! it means more ideas and more polish! maybe... even MORE levels to make music for!&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141227105920im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/evil.gif" alt="Evil" border="0"> <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141227105920im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/evil.gif" alt="Evil" border="0"> <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141227105920im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/evil.gif" alt="Evil" border="0"> <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141227105920im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/evil.gif" alt="Evil" border="0"> <br></div>as a que to keep pushing my deadline further and further away towards eternity ~ bad move James <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141227105920im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/evil.gif" alt="Evil" border="0"><br><br>Nah, just kidding <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141227105920im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0"> <br><br>But, when we are on this lazy note, I should probably announce that I&#039;m taking a christmas break, as you have probably noticed. And another thing - this spring I&#039;m going on a longer trip, I&#039;ll get on the plane somewhere mid-january. James and I have been talking, and we&#039;re agreed that it would be impossible to rush a release until then, especially when taking things such as setting up a small website and the like into account. So instead the (already unspecified) release will be pushed two or three months forward into the next year. In the end this is a hobby, and as such I have to put life first, Rain World second. This said I myself don&#039;t think of it as something entirely negative for Rain World, as getting away from my screen and recieving some new impressions is good for my enthusiasm and inspiration, which in turn is what fuels the project.<br><br>In-between christmas break and travel break I hope to get some work done on the main menu, so that when I get back after my longer break full of inspiration I&#039;m not met by a wall of user interface coding~ If I get a good chunk of menu made before I go that&#039;ll actually mean that most technical aspects of the game will be almost finished, and that means I can concentrate on giving it an awesome artistic presentation when I get back.

Thank you!<br><br><b>Update 67</b><br>More playing around with palettes. I made a palette to be used for underground areas, with the main difference being that instead of close objects being darker and faraway ones being light it&#039;s the other way around. <br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20200806011925im_/http://oi50.tinypic.com/xp63o6.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br><br>I also added a system for having a little blur effects going on, but it&#039;ll be used rather sparesly as I don&#039;t want to stray too far from the pixel art style.<br><br>I&#039;m hesitating to start making actual levels for the game, as I suddenly find myself doubting whether the game layout I had imagined would be the best one possible. The idea was that there would be a small hub world in which you could move freely, and that you&#039;d visit the different levels from there. Moving around freely is always fun, but the question is how much it actually adds. If I make the game linear I can do a lot more interesting things such as changing light and weather conditions, and in the end show off more of my world. In an open world where you can move back and forth as you please it&#039;s very weird if one area always is during the sunset, while the neighbouring place has broad daylight. Instead the whole world would have to have more or less the same conditions, as there&#039;s no way I could render all the levels during all the light conditions times all the weather conditions....<br><br>So, moving around freely in a more bland world, or play a linear game in a more interesting and diverse one? Hmm...

I&#039;m not really talking about the background art specifically, as I feel the foreground stuff has the same problems. Instead of looking like something that&#039;s consistent enough to be meant to function in one way or another, it just looks like a clutter of small building blocks... which is exactly what it is -.-<br><br>Yeah, the poles certainly could stand out more. The wierd thing is that in a way the level looks better and is more readable when there&#039;s no light at all, as such:<br><br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141225223743/http://oi49.tinypic.com/mn27wx.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141225223743im_/http://oi49.tinypic.com/mn27wx.jpg" alt="" width="270" height="200" border="0"></a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141225223743/http://oi50.tinypic.com/692deu.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141225223743im_/http://oi50.tinypic.com/692deu.jpg" alt="" width="270" height="200" border="0"></a><br>(Old one to the right for reference)<br><br>because then there&#039;s only one, simple rule - darker=closer. Buuut I really do enjoy having the light fade out when the rain is approaching, and I&#039;ve put so much work into the shadow renderer already.<br><br>Anyway, I removed some of the clutter from behind the poles, and kept it a stone wall that doesn&#039;t draw too much attention!

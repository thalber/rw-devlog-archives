<b>Update 86</b><br>Further work on the engine that will handle the *game* aspect of this thing, the one which will divide the world into levels, lead you to places in a certain order, remember what places you&#039;ve already visited and so on.<br><br>What&#039;s up an running right now is this:<br>The player are free to access the swarm rooms in whatever order they see fit. There is, however, a recommended order. This means that each of the seven <i>hunts </i>has an assigned <i>swarm room</i>, and during that hunt you will be lead to that swarm room by the lead flies. If you play like this the game is basically linear.<br><br>But, you can visit any swarm room any time. However, once you&#039;ve hunted in a swarm room it won&#039;t swarm the next hunt - meaning that if you go to room 5 the first thing you do, there&#039;ll be trouble once the game arrives at hunt 5, because the recommended room is already used up. In this case it&#039;ll just lead you to the closest active room (thank god for A*). Then there are other interesting alternatives, such as the player cathing a few flies in one swarm room, then visiting another one before going back to the den ... <br><br>The effect of all this is supposed to be that the first time you play the game it&#039;ll be all dandy, and the game will you lead you by the hand and show you all the levels. The next playthough, when you&#039;re looking to break a high score, you have the possibility to be tactical in your play style instead.<br><br>This is supposed to effectively be two difficulties in one - if you play by the rules it&#039;s easier, but you can also go rouge and lose the help the game was providing, in return for a potentially higher score.

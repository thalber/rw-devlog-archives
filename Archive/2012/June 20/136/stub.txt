<b>Update 62</b><br>Today I finally started to make changes to the different lizards&#039; bodies. It&#039;s fun to see how much difference it makes to just make small adjustments such as making them fat/skinny, short tail/long tail and things like that. I also started on making different heads for them. I think the graphics will help giving them fun different personalities. Pics soon.

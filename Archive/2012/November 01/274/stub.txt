<b>Update 110</b><br>Now the game has flies - not the creature I&#039;ve been calling &quot;fly&quot; but frankly is looking more like a bat kind of thing - but actual tiny little flies that buzz around. It doesn&#039;t really make any difference, but I hope it makes the world seem a little more lively.

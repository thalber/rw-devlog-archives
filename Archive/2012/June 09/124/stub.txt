Yeah, the corridors are a bit different. Essentially there are two games, one that&#039;s a maze game like pac-man, when in the corridors, and one that&#039;s a platformer, when out in open areas. When out in the open the game is more about jumping and doing cool moves to avoid crocs that have inevitably seen you, while in the corridors the game is about making them never spot you in the first place. Try to play slower, and make sure they don&#039;t see you.<br><br>I&#039;ll look at the ledge stuff!<br><br><b>Update 53</b><br>As you who played the alpha are aware of, the flies are able to dive back in their hives when chased. I did some tweaking of this today, and made it so that burrowing takes a little bit of time for them, instead of them dissapearing on contact with the floor. This means that if you&#039;re right behind them you can still catch them while they&#039;re burrowing, making it a little bit easier and less unfair. To compensate for this I also implemented that flies won&#039;t appear out of a hive that a player is close to, so that you can&#039;t just wait on a hive for them to pop up and then exploit that they can&#039;t dissapear as quickly.<br><br>Furthermore, the croc AI had an error going on in its simulation of the movement of unseen players. It would assume that a player would fall through the passable floors, making it behave weird in a situation where the croc is below a floor with a player up above. As soon as the croc left the site to get to the player it would imagine that the player had fallen down to the lower level, and turn around. Once there, it would see that the player was actually still up there, and turn around again. This behvaiour would then repeat. It was easily fixed by making the &quot;ghost player&quot; in the croc&#039;s head interact with platforms in another way, which has probably created a whole batch of new, exciting errors for me to discover tomorrow!

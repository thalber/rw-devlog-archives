you are talking about the background artwork I gather? IMHO it looks pretty good! I kind of agree with on the more detailed stuff though. the top and middle sections are nice because its just a solid clean silhouette and doesn&#039;t get in the way of the foreground stuff. the bottom background could be a bit less detailed maybe, not necessarily as rule but because the poles are such an important part of that level and need to more visually &quot;present&quot; I think. As it is now the poles kind of mix in with the background machines.<br><br>just my 2 cents! I love the art, you know that <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141225223743im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0">

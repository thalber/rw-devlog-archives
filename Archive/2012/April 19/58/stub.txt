Wow, those are some really cool palettes!<br><br>Thing is though, that the game will be pretty heavily stylized art-direction wise, using a more or less black and white palette. This is for artistic reasons that I hope will be more clear once I get more visual stuff up here. Talking of which, I did some pen and paper designs for the croc today! Also started to implement it a little bit, it now looks like a little sasuage moving around rather than three dots. A first few steps towards giving it an actual body!<br><br><b>Update 28</b><br>I stepped away from my computer a little and did some sketches for the earliest single player levels in the game. I think this is a reasonable way to start, because if I know what levels I want to make I can make art assets that fit those, rather than making a lot of random art assets and then trying to fit those into the levels.<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129232222im_/http://oi40.tinypic.com/2sbl7d2.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Those are likely going to be the very first levels, but they are also likely to look different from this. These levels will teach the players the controls and the basic premiss of the game.

I won&#039;t go into too much detail, but level 1 basically teaches you how your basic moves work, and level 2 teaches you the basic mechanics of A-creature/B-creature interaction.<br><br>The main thing that happened today, aside from all this, was that I split the level editor and the game into two different applications. It got too cluttered, and I also figured that this way I might be able to release the two separately. That way people who&#039;re not interested in making levels get a smaller file size, and I can also release them at different dates, meaning I don&#039;t have to polish the level editor to perfection just to release the game.

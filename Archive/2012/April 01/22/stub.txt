<b>Update 9</b><br>Quite a lot of progress today, all happening inside the croc&#039;s head. Some basic behaviours are up and running, such as searching, idling, hunting. <br><br>The one that has been hardest so far is the &quot;investigate&quot; behaviour, where a croc is given a tile and is supposed to check out its immediate surroundings. Currently I do this by sending out a few &quot;scout&quot; checkpoints from the main checkpoint, they travel only in tiles that are accessable to the croc and stop after a few steps. The Croc then proceeds to check out the main tile and the &quot;scouts&quot; surrounding it, after which it considers the area investigated.<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129224152im_/http://oi43.tinypic.com/348ha49.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br><br>The hunting behaviour needs a lot of work. Especially when the player dissapears around a corner the behaviour is too unintelligent, in situations where it&#039;s fairly easy to estimate where the player might have gone it should do so.

<b>Update 8</b><br>I have started working on the AI today. What I&#039;ve done up until now is path finding, getting from one place to another, but there has to be an AI that makes decisions on what places it wants to get to.<br><br>I do not want the croc to be omniscient, it will have to see its prey to know where it is. This will add a slight element of sneaking to the game, you&#039;ll want to take routes where the crocs can&#039;t see you. <br><br>In order for a unit to be able to navigate without <i>knowing </i>where everything is, it has to be able to have an <i>estimation </i>of where things are. This means a little mental mirror of sorts, that will sometimes cohere with and sometimes deviate from the real world.<br><br>This is what I&#039;ve been doing today. Each Croc has a list of where it thinks the players are. For each player it can have a few different ideas, simplified they could be boiled down to:<br><br>Visual contact - I know where this particular player is because I see him.<br>No Idea - I have no idea where this player is.<br>Memory - I remember the last place I saw this player.<br><br>This is the framework I&#039;ve been working on today. If the Croc has a memory about where it last saw a player and returns to that place<i> without spotting the player there</i> the memory will be deleted, and it once again has &quot;No Idea&quot; about where that player is. It also keeps track of how long ago it saw a player, maybe a memory will be deleted after a while because it&#039;s very unlikely that the player would remain anywhere close to that spot. As of now the crocs can&#039;t act on this information, but I&#039;ll get to that later.<br><br>The idea behind this is that if a croc hunts player 1, and in the corner of its eye sees player 2, then if it later looses track of player 1 it will be able to return to that point where player 2 was spotted. I will probably have to create some behaviour for searching the surroundings of a place, so that if it returns to a place where it remembered a player being it doesn&#039;t just give up, but looks around the area a little first. <br><br>Different crocs will probably have different mental stats as well as physical, with adjustments to memory, patience and the like.

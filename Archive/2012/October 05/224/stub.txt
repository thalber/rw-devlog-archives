Thank you! Now some of the bigger graphical assets are coming together, and the visual style of the game is slowly taking another direction. I think you&#039;ll like it!<br><br>James, I think that thing will be kept to co-op play, because no matter how hard I would make getting away by yourself someone would eventually learn to master it, and then the most dominant game play element (getting away from lizards) would be taken away from the game.<br><br><b>Update 96</b><br>A lot has happened. James has been creating a set of super awesome ambient sounds, that really help setting a mood. Next up is implementing those. Together with the music I&#039;m convinced they&#039;ll make magic happen and take the game to a level which is higher than the sum of the parts. <br><br>I&#039;ve done a few things programming-wise. Most importantly I&#039;ve added a new &quot;creature&quot;, that is a .... bubble barnacle - or rather a bubble coming out of a short cut entrance (the source of all life in this world, it seems). The bubbles just sit around there, and when flies touch them they are trapped inside. Once a few flies are trapped the bubble retracts, and the creature inside the short cut presumably consumes the flies.<br><br>The fun thing is their self defence, which consists of popping violently. This can throw a player around pretty far, and is generally hated by lizards. <br><br>Other things added:<br>Blue lizards (which are the lightest, and most vulnerable to rocks) react the same way to a player holding a rock as to a player holding a stone - by attacking from above. In some situations it&#039;s really fun to watch, like if you&#039;re being hunted on the ground by a lizard and makes it to pick up a pebble or a spear from the ground. The lizard can then turn away from you, climb up a wall, climb on the ceiling out above you and then drop down on you. It looks pretty smart!<br>Red lizards can destroy spears.<br>Fixed a bug in the level renderer which made short cuts invisible if there was a blurred light overlapping them.<br>Created a dynamic system for how each level can have a &quot;light behaviour&quot; attached to it - right now there are &quot;no light&quot;, &quot;static&quot;, &quot;clouds&quot; and &quot;thunder&quot; to choose from. <br>Fixed some random bugs concerning light not being displayed over the entire screen.<br>Fixed some bugs in the level renderer.<br>Made it more reasonable what lizards tend to pick up what objects.<br>Added features in the level editor - such as a slider to decide how much dripping water a level will contain. More of those are needed.<br><br>There are a few important things on my to-do list that I need to get to ASAP, but I keep pushing forward. Among those are:<br>An acutal look for the hives, so that you can see where a fly will be able to burrow down.<br>Settings for max amount of flies and fly respawn rates for a level.<br>Ambience sound and music implementation.<br>Start on building the actual main menu.<br>Active decorative objects for the world to make it appear more alive.<br><br>Hopefully the upcoming things will magically progress 6 times faster than the things I&#039;ve already done, and the game will ever be finished!<br>

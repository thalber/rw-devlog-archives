Screenshot!<br><br>This is the swarm level of the &quot;Canopy&quot; area, which is high up and set during the sun set/rise. This is the second last area according to the recommended order.<br><br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141223132645/http://oi47.tinypic.com/23tja5j.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141223132645im_/http://oi47.tinypic.com/23tja5j.jpg" alt="" width="270" height="200" border="0"></a><br><br>The blue of the lizard will probably switch to the blue effect color of the level (seen here in the signs) to create visual consistency, if I ever get around to it. It&#039;s a hassle because some of the lizards have colored body parts that are bitmaps unchangeable from the code.<br><br>On that - I&#039;ve been doing a little bit of variety among the lizards look-wise, they have a little different looking eyes and so on. The red one has huge teeth.<br><br>For those of you who have been around a long time it might be fun to notice the little machine boxes with 2x2 grated holes in them, those have been around for a looong time and were originally made mostly to check out that the voxelly graphics renderer thingy worked properly. I grew fond of them and now they&#039;ll probably make it into the final thing.<br><br>EDIT: Added a new plant, along with a new way to add plants - one by one. This framework will come in real useful later.

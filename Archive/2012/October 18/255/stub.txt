There&#039;s one kind of lizard that co-operates, but I haven&#039;t really found a good place for it in the game and it might end up being banished to custom mode. They work together by trying to surround the player, which sometimes ends up pretty dangerous.<br><br>I think the main problem here is the very simple environment. In the end they can&#039;t really do much more than... go places, their possibilities of interaction are very limited. When I enabled them to pick up objects occasionally that was pretty cool though.<br><br>On the AI, I think I&#039;ve reached a &quot;good enough&quot; point, from now on everything I&#039;d add wouldn&#039;t really ever be visible to the casual player. I have a few fun things in there for those who play a little more as well, but I think I&#039;ll keep it at this.<br><br>Current progress isn&#039;t very fast, as that damned cough won&#039;t leave me alone. Working and being sick is quite enough for each day, and it&#039;s hard to find time for rain world. Hopefully it&#039;ll be over soon, please just be patient for a couple of days! I try to get at least something done every day even though I&#039;m a bit tired.

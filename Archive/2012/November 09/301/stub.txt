Surprisingly brutal for something so cute. I imagine the sounds are placeholder- I hope they&#039;ll be replaced with something more fleshy and visceral.<br>Also, what&#039;s the structure of this game? I don&#039;t have the willpower to look through the whole thread to find out- how does the game play? I only know the mechanics, not the goal or anything.<br></div>Hehe the sounds you&#039;re hearing are made by me, and I&#039;m an amateur sound-wise. Whatever gets updated depends on whether or not my awesome sound guy has a sudden gust of inspiration!<br><br>The goal of the game is to catch and eat flies, not portrayed here, while at the same time avoiding the lizards with sneaking and jumping. Killing a lizard is just a means of survival, not an in-game goal.<br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141227133745/http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.msg814001#msg814001">Quote from: Vovosunt on November 09, 2012, 04:04:59 AM</a></div><div class="quote">BTW, are the characters sprite-animated or do they have bones?<br>(Seems like bones, but I&#039;m not sure...)<br></div>I don&#039;t know exactly what &quot;bones&quot; is, have heard of it some time... but yeah, I think it might be the thing. The characters are made of several parts that interact according to simple physics.<br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141227133745/http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.msg814006#msg814006">Quote from: DrDerekDoctors on November 09, 2012, 04:17:49 AM</a></div><div class="quote">Nice! Take *that* you shitty lizard! Bam! Love the way it frantically backs off, injured, too.<br></div>Hehe yeah! The spears almost always end up sticking out of their throats, beacause whenever they spot you they turn towards you and open their mouths. It backs off because if the tip of a spear that&#039;s stuck in its body interacts with terrain it gets a little spams in the other direction. <br><br>Suddenly I realize how gruesome this stuff is XD

Awesome vid! &nbsp;I&#039;m have yet to play it 2 player, but the thought of tag teaming those lizard bastard makes me smile &nbsp;<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141227133745im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/evil.gif" alt="Evil" border="0"><br><br>As for the place-holder SFX that JLJac did... I think I&#039;ve played it so much that I&#039;m used to them and kind of like them! I had thought of just touching them up a bit down the road to blend with the newer SFX, but this is probably a good time to get your opinions oh wise TIG brethren. We have one vote for more &quot;fleshy&quot; (realistic I&#039;m guessing?) sounds. Does anybody else have an opinion based on what you&#039;ve heard in this vid?

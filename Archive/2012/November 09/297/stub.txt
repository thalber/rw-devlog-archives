A video!<br><br>Click the image!<br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141227094548/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNYTIxHQ3jk&amp;feature=plcp" target="_blank"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141227094548im_/http://oi49.tinypic.com/33w6u0l.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a><br><br>The video shows how you can play with the lizard AI - I, the white player, have a rock, and my friend has a spear. I attract the attention of the croc, and make it follow me. When the croc see me dissapear down the ledge it assumes I dropped to the bottom, and decides to drop down as well. Once down there it realizes that was not the case, and crawls back up to investigate where I might have gone. My friend is waiting for it with the spear.<br><br>This is of course an artifical situation, but it shows how the semi-predictable AI can affect the way you play. It&#039;s possible to make a plan based on what you&#039;d think be a reasonable behaviour for the croc, and put it in motion. Not all plans will work as smoothly as this one of course, but I hope there will be fun in the element of surprise as well!

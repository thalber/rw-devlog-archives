<b>Update 76</b><br>Finally I took some time to work on some graphics!<br>Today I did the intricate pipe tileset, the big heads and the moss like plant shown in this screenshot.<br><br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200806012324/http://oi49.tinypic.com/zty736.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20200806012324im_/http://oi49.tinypic.com/zty736.jpg" alt="" width="270" height="200" border="0"></a><br><br>Note how the head thingie is a little three-dimensional, you can se the slightest difference in direction between the leftmost and the rightmost face, and on the ones in the background you can see how the shadows play a little over the shapes in a way they wouldn&#039;t if they were entirely flat. <br><br>As always when I have schoolwork hanging over me I got terribly inspired, and still have ideas for pieces of graphics I didn&#039;t have time to do today. But I&#039;ll get to them!<br><br>Slowly but surely I&#039;m getting to the point where the world starts to take shape, and I can work more with actually conveying what this place looks like rather than just working on the tools I need to get there. Still, there&#039;s a lot of tool making left to do...

Thanks! I hope you'll like the final visuals even more!<br><br><b>Update 1</b><br>I have worked a little with the Croc's movement, the physics of its body. Earlier I've mainly been working with the path finding, now I'm moving over to how it will animate when following those paths. Cleaned up a few situations where it would get stuck, and made it so that if it is, for some reason, cornered in a dead end it will swallow its pride and slowly and awkwardly back out again. Also identified a... path finding error... -.- Will get to that later.<br><br>Another three hours or so I've spent struggling with the eldrich horrors of recording, trimming and cropping a little gameplay video.<br><br>This seems to be in the same category as printers, a seemingly menial task that for some unknown reason coheres with an undescribable, inherent blind spot in human engineering, making it about a bazillion times as difficult as it has to be. Nothing can ever, under any circumstances, just simply work... Well, I'm out of patience, maybe tomorrow there will be a vid.<br>

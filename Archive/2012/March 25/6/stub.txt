Haha! Yeah, the idea is that a food chain of three is the smallest possible where one unit can be both hunting and hunted, making for an interesting situation for the player. I could possibly make the other units playable as well, but, as you said, the gameplay as those would be more one-sided. Creature B can't really be computer controlled though, download the prototype to see for yourself why... Way too complicated movement for an AI to handle :O<br><br>I was also thinking about some plant or something for creature A... Stick around and we'll see what happens!<br><br><b>Update 2</b><br>Made the speed of the croc variable, across different sub-species and different terrains. For example, one could be a quick runner but a slow climber, while another one has other stats. Gravity now affects the croc, and its body has some substance so that the body parts won't collapse into themselves (as much). Path finding seems to be working nicely now, I haven't seen it getting stuck for a while. What needs work though is the behaviour when it's thinking about a path but doesn't have one yet, it should probably slow down while thinking stuff over instead of rushing around at random.

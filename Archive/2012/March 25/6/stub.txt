Haha! Yeah, the idea is that a food chain of three is the smallest possible where one unit can be both hunting and hunted, making for an interesting situation for the player. I could possibly make the other units playable as well, but, as you said, the gameplay as those would be more one-sided. Creature B can&#039;t really be computer controlled though, download the prototype to see for yourself why... Way too complicated movement for an AI to handle :O<br><br>I was also thinking about some plant or something for creature A... Stick around and we&#039;ll see what happens!<br><br><b>Update 2</b><br>Made the speed of the croc variable, across different sub-species and different terrains. For example, one could be a quick runner but a slow climber, while another one has other stats. Gravity now affects the croc, and its body has some substance so that the body parts won&#039;t collapse into themselves (as much). Path finding seems to be working nicely now, I haven&#039;t seen it getting stuck for a while. What needs work though is the behaviour when it&#039;s thinking about a path but doesn&#039;t have one yet, it should probably slow down while thinking stuff over instead of rushing around at random.

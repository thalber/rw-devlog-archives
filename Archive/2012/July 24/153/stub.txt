Hi there!<br>Contrary to what you&#039;re all probably thinking by now neither I nor the project is dead. Things have actually happened, even!<br><br>Yesterday the above decision was made final by me implementing the framework for moving between levels, and setting up two different game types, &quot;custom&quot; and &quot;world&quot;. This means we have a hub world layout. <br><br>Pretty much every game these days do the kind of cop-out I was thinking about, where they promise something dynamic and interesting, only to cut all the corners and provide a linear movie-game. I don&#039;t wanna do the same. <br><br>Things that have happened, just the few at the top of my head:<br>1-lizard AI of course. <br>2-Graphics for the A creature, and additional behaviour<br>3-Started to implement sound(which I&#039;m not very good at)<br>4-framrate stuff<br>5-level editor stuff<br>6-connecting levels so that you can move between them<br>7-endless tinkering with the palettes<br>And quite a lot of other things that had to be done but are not very interesting. There&#039;s more stuff, but instead of listing it all it&#039;ll be nice surprises for you when you notice it. Think of it as &quot;free progress&quot; you didn&#039;t think it was happening, but it was~<br><br>I hope I&#039;ll be able to get back to regular updates shortly.<br>Thank you for having patience!

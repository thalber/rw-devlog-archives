<b>Update 15</b><br><br>Limited the lizard&#039;s angle of vision. <br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129224152im_/http://oi40.tinypic.com/23wjzgh.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Since the main thing making the game easy already is the croc not knowing where you are, the limitation is more in terms of not being able to see backwards rather than only being able to see forwards. Anyways, this allows you to wait in a side tunnel for a lizard to crawl by, and then crawl out behind it and get away.<br><br>You see the little bulge of vision covering the tail? If the point that&#039;s tested is close enough the angle is not tested, to simulate some kind of spatial sense and so that the player can&#039;t crawl into its tail without being noticed. <br><br>In an open level like this a lizard in the right position can cover huge areas, and two of them can see pretty much the whole level. <br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129224152im_/http://oi40.tinypic.com/1zz2bua.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br><br>I think this works well, because open areas are not the crocs&#039; favourite environment to move in. This creates a balance - close quarters: they won&#039;t spot you, but if they do you&#039;re done for. Open spaces: they&#039;ll spot you, but you have a fair chance of getting away.

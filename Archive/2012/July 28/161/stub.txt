<b>Update 72</b><br>Did some brushing up on the work I did yesterday. Now your score follows you between levels, as well as the flies you&#039;re holding in your hands and how many bites you&#039;ve taken out of them.<br><br>I also noticed that it&#039;s way too easy to catch the &quot;lead flies&quot; as I call them, the ones that inhabit the hub world and are there to lead you to the actual level you&#039;re going for. I put in some pretty harsh measures to keep you from catching those, because otherwise you&#039;d never go to the levels but spend your entire time going back and forth between the first and the second room in the hub world, and that wouldn&#039;t make a very good game.<br><br>So, now there will only appear lead flies once in each level and each direction. This means that if you&#039;ve already had your chance at seeing where to go in a room, they won&#039;t appear there again.<br><br>On top of this there&#039;s a counter, so if you catch too many lead flies they&#039;ll simply stop appearing. This symbolizes that it&#039;s actually the same few flies you chase through all the rooms, and catching and killing them will ruin your opportunity to follow them to where their friends are. I guess that the first time you see one there could be a message saying &quot;don&#039;t catch it, it&#039;ll lead you to the others&quot; or something like that.<br><br>The effect of this whole system is supposed to be that if you&#039;re a first time player and play by the book, you&#039;ll easily be able to follow the lead flies to the closest swarming room. If you&#039;re an experienced player trying to exploit it, they&#039;ll dissappear. The goal is that the game should be... not easy, but fair, as long as you&#039;re playing fair. If you mess with it you ought to know what you&#039;re doing, because then the help will be withdrawn.

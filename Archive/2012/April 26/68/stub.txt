<b>Update 35</b><br>Effects editor more or less done! You can create effects and paint their area of influence, like so:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170608092325im_/http://oi49.tinypic.com/2jepyft.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Variable brush size and all! This has been a user interface hell -.-<br><br>Later on the effects editor is how plants will get into the game. Right now it can do some erosion. In the game it won&#039;t be this extreme, I think, this is just to show you what it can do. For example the poles can&#039;t be allowed to grow into huge trunks. <br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170608092325im_/http://oi45.tinypic.com/xbn4gl.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br><br>The idea is to unify the tiles into one image, and to add an organic feel to the level. You can change the order in which effects are applied, which will have some significance. If you for example want the terrain to be heavily erroded but not the plants growing there, you can place the plants below the erosion in the effects list. If you, on the other hand, want dead plants with slime hanging from them, you apply the slime after the plants are drawn.<br><br>With the painting tool you can create gradients, like this:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170608092325im_/http://oi50.tinypic.com/zttzme.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Se how the geometry is molten to goo at the left side, but untouched with visible little pins and all at the right side? That&#039;s an effect gradient. It&#039;s possible to single out specific tiles to be affected or excluded as well, even though I don&#039;t know how that&#039;ll look...<br><br>This is one step closer to the landscapes that have been floating around in my mind for a while, heavily eroded industrial complexes with patches of old stone. In order to explain why I focus so much on erosion it might be appropriate that I start giving away a little about the overall concept. The working title I have at this point is <br><i>Rain World</i>.

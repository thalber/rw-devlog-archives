<b>Update 6</b><br><br>Added the ability to balance on the tip of a pole.<br><br><img src="./Project Rain World_files/xqgm0.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br><br>There are two ways to access this mode, you can climb up a pole, and you can land on it from the air with a well timed key press. The Bear doesn't automatically land on poles, you have to press the "up" arrow at the exact right moment, making jumping between poles very difficult.<br><br>I like to add some stuff like this that's very hard to do but won't really be required in any level, so that players who have played for a long time will always have fresh challenges.

I will talk about something that&#039;s not path finding for a change.<br><br>As you might remember the Bear has two major modes of movement, standing up and crawling. I don&#039;t remember the exact numbers, but I think that you&#039;re almost twice as fast when running. The croc, as it stands, moves with a speed that&#039;s variable depending on terrain, but will move along a floor with the same speed as it would a horizontal tunnel. If the tiles directly above are a ceiling or open air doesn&#039;t affect it.<br><br>This means that right now this<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210224131114im_/http://oi44.tinypic.com/1zx19gi.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br><br>is no problem what so ever, while this <br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210224131114im_/http://oi42.tinypic.com/avn2ar.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br><br>is a HUGE problem. A branchless corridor is more or less a countdown to death.<br><br>I like it that the Croc is faster than you in some situations and slower in some, but it might be too extreme. I don&#039;t want the player to avoid tunnels entirely. If I make the croc slower over all it will be way too slow out in the open, if I make it faster it&#039;ll be way too fast in tunnels.<br><br>Currently I&#039;m thinking about maybe making the croc able to stretch its legs when outside a tunnel, and gain a little extra speed to match the player&#039;s ability to stand up and run. Still, this would mean making the Croc closer to the Bear in terms of movement, and maybe it&#039;s a good thing that they have those differences... Hm... Maybe this is a question of level design, levels should simply be designed in a way that makes both the player and the croc stand a fair chance.<br><br>Another problem that arises is that if the Croc is vastly inferior on open floors but much faster in close quarters the AI should probably somehow be aware of this. How would that work?<br><br>A lot of decisions here. Maybe I&#039;ll just wait until the basic gameplay is up and working, and see what needs to be balanced.

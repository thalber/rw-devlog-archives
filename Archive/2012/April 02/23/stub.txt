<b>Update 10</b><br>The AI is coming together, and is now actually playable against (Even though there still aren&#039;t any effects from a croc colliding with you). The behaviour is now considerably more competent when it comes to pursuing you, if you for example disappear around a corner it will make a little &quot;simulation&quot; of where you might&#039;ve gone, and act according to that estimation. It&#039;s all very simple, but seems to be working fine. <br><br>As it stands the lizards mill about the level idly until they see a player. Then they start hunting, and if the loose track of the player during the hunt they&#039;ll look around the area where they last saw him. If the player was moving during the last visual contact they crocs will estimate where he might have ended up since then, and look around that place instead.<br><br>One fun thing is the effects of having different ways of calculating visual contact and path finding. This means that a Croc can see a Bear across a gap, but to get there it has to take a much longer way. <br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129224152im_/http://oi43.tinypic.com/imnkoo.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br><br>I like these situations because here you can see the intelligence at work, you know that it doesn&#039;t just charge towards close targets, but it&#039;s actually able to plan a long and complicated route to get to a place. I&#039;ll try to make a video some time soon.<br><br>In the situation in the picture the player would probably be nowhere near that same place once the Croc finally arrives, and it&#039;ll use the &quot;investigate&quot; behaviour of the above post to look around for a little while before giving up and roaming the map again. I&#039;m pretty happy with how all this is coming together.<br><br>I have noticed a few situations where Crocs get stuck though, will have to work on that.

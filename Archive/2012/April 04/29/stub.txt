Thank you. Even coming from someone with [/sarcasm] in their sig it means a lot to the crocs, they send their regards.<br><br><b>Update 13</b><br>I gotta say, today was a good day. Not because I was very productive, but because I tested stuff and it worked. <br><br>I made this crazy level:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129224152im_/http://oi44.tinypic.com/14deex0.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br><br>and had two crocs plus four A-creatures run around on it, along with a player. Implemented that if a player touches an A-creature it dissapears and a score counter increases, no animations and no nothing, but still enough to start trying stuff out soon. It&#039;s a game!<br><br>The crocs adapt well to different environments. They are able to navigate a maze like this without looking too clueless, at least to me. <br><br>One thing I&#039;ve started to notice about how the game turns out is that there is much more emphasis on not being seen by the crocs than I had anticipated. For some reason I imagined that the Crocs would know where you were pretty much most times, and the gameplay would be about hunting/fleeing. Unless I want the Crocs to see through walls this is not really possible though, if you&#039;re behind a wall you&#039;re behind a wall and the Croc shouldn&#039;t know your exact position. <br><br>The hunt/flee type of game play had a problem, if the croc would constantly be chasing the player I pretty much would have only two options: Either the croc is slower than the player, and will never ever pose any threat because it&#039;s unable to catch up. Or, the croc is faster than the player, and <i>will </i>catch up and kill you within a very limited time, no way to avoid it. <br><br>As it looks right now the game is leaning more towards a platformer/sneaker than an action platformer as I had originally planned. I have nothing against this, if that&#039;s the direction the project wants to go I&#039;ll allow it. I like the feeling that the crocs are physically superior to you, they outrun you easily, the only way to survive is to out smart them. This is a perspective I think is fairly rare in games. (Actually your only advantage to the crocs is your overview, if your vision was as limited as theirs you would be A-B-S-O-L-U-T-E-L-Y C-H-A-N-C-E-L-E-S-S, but it <i>feels </i>as if you&#039;re out smarting them!)<br><br>Ok, it&#039;ll be a long post today.<br><br>You see the little yellow things on the level editor screen shot? Those are hives. I felt that the C-creature had an objective, eating the B-creature, and the B-creature had an objective, eating the A-creature, but A was without any motivation. What would it do, just hang around one part of the map until it got chased to another part of the map? I wanted it to <i>do </i>something.<br><br>The hives are places where A-creatures spawn, and then during their life time they move around from one hive to another as if transporting something or what will you. This makes them motivated to go somewhere instead of just roaming by random. The behaviour looks a bit ant like, they have their paths between the hives where they move back and forth, until a player chases them and puts them off their course. <br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129224152im_/http://oi44.tinypic.com/2remrsi.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br><br>The idea is that they should be able to dive down into their hives and dissapear, so that the player has to ambush them on their routes instead. <br><br>Unlike the other creatures the A-creature will be respawned when killed, and therefore needs a logical respawning place instead of just popping up from nowhere. <br><br>The path finding seems to be more or less behind me and hopefully the pace will increase from here on! Soon I&#039;ll make a video or demo or something so you can see the stuff in motion.

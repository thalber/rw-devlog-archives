<b>Update 12</b><br>Fixed some quirks and the above mentioned problem in the croc path finding. I pray this is the last time I write the words &quot;croc path finding&quot; in this dev log. Also improved the croc&#039;s estimation of where a player might have gone.<br><br>I didn&#039;t get around to write this as it was something that was finished before I started writing the log, but on the levels there are &quot;short cuts&quot;, holes you can crawl into and be transported to another hole elsewhere on the map. This feature was included to make the levels less limited by being two dimensional, with a short cut it&#039;s possible to make a path that crosses another path without actually connecting to it, if you get what I mean. You can see the short cuts as the little white dots on the level editor screen shot in the original post, you probably already figured out what they where.<br><br>All three creatures in the game are able to use the short cuts, even though the A creature is very hesistant to enter one unless there&#039;s no other way around (it knows that a player might see it, and position himself at the exit for an easy kill). The croc path finding (DAMMIT!) has been able to handle those for a long time, and the crocs use them to transport themselves around the map. If a croc sees a player entering a short cut it doesn&#039;t simply follow him, but makes an independent estimation of what way is the quickest to get to the exit, through the short cut or by foot. If it&#039;s the latter an unpleasant surprise awaits you when you exit.<br><br>The AI creatures are assumed to be aware of the entire map lay out, it&#039;s only the players&#039; position they don&#039;t know about unless there is visual contact.<br><br>Today&#039;s progress includes that if a croc doesn&#039;t explicitly <i>see </i>a player entering a short cut, but sees him dissapearing into a corridor that leads to a short cut, it will still be able to figure out what might have happened.

I&#039;m thinking about releasing an alpha, so that a few first time players can try the game and provide some feedback.<br><br><b>Please let me know if you want to contribute by playtesting.</b><br><br>The alpha will be stripped of all art, it&#039;ll just be a couple of levels that you can try running around in, and some settings that you can change, to let me know what you think is a reasonable difficulty. I will only send away a maximum of five games, as I don&#039;t want to release an ugly, unfinished product to the public.<br><br>If you contact me and I send you a copy I will want some effort in return, probably a small sheet of questions answered, of course along with any free-form feedback you want to provide. The final product will of course be free, and if you want to do a little free work for me in return it&#039;ll be greatly appreciated.<br><br>The alpha won&#039;t be very cool, it&#039;ll probably suck, but by playing it you can contribute in making the final product something much cooler!

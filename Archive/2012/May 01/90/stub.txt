<b>Update 40</b><br>Did some thinking on the layout of the game. At first I thought I wanted the campaign to be completely linear, but I changed my mind. If you are free to move a little between levels that adds two values. Firstly most people like to be able to move freely. Second, it means that the same levels will be passed several times, increasing the gameplay time/development time ratio. The idea is that during a &quot;level&quot; the player is supposed to get to a hunting ground with flies, hunt, and then get back within a limited time. More on this later.<br><br>I did some easy but important stuff with the Croc&#039;s thinking, again. For example there was a bug that if it saw you enter a shortcut it wouldn&#039;t always understand where you&#039;d end up.<br><br>Did I mention that the croc does a little simulation of the player&#039;s movement in its head if it&#039;s unable to see a player? I made the physics of that simulation better, for example I added gravity. The simulated player also has a minimal amount of &quot;AI&quot;, which will simulate the movement of a player character a slight bit better than just an object that continues in the direction of the tangent. This means that if the croc sees you passing by and dissapear into a corridor it&#039;ll have a slightly better hunch of where you might have gone once you left its field of vision.<br><br>Now, when a croc catches up with a player, it picks it up in its (yet nonexistent) mouth and quickly carries it back to its hole.

<b>Update 61</b><br>Hopefully managed to solve the searching twice problem.<br>The arms and legs ended up needing quite a lot of sprites.<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141214231912im_/http://oi47.tinypic.com/2qtzpeb.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br><br>What you see here is the arm, in 0-8 extension modes and three different degrees of rotation towards the viewer, where the topmost is a profile where you see the bend of the elbow, while the third row is the same arm viewed from &quot;above&quot;. Rows 4-6 are the same thing, but for the leg.<br><br>I have also worked a little bit on the stats for the crocs, starting to differentiate them from each other. The fifth and final(?) species is in now, which is the white croc. This makes them five:<br><br><span style="color: green;">Green</span> - Big, strong, dumb, easy. Lazy, is mostly staying still unless it sees a player.<br><span style="color: purple;">Pink</span> - Standard. Can climb poles, decently smart, OK hearing.<br><span style="color: blue;">Blue</span> - Wall climber. Prefers to hang around walls or ceilings rather than floors and passages.<br>White - Stealthy. Can climb walls but not ceilings. Sits still and changes color to blend into its environment.<br><span style="color: red;">Red</span> - Hard. Fast, smart, superb hearing. Never stops, but is constantly moving around the map.<br><br>The white lizard will behave a little differently, because its tactic is not pursuing, but ambushing. It sits completely still on a wall, and blends into the background so that it&#039;s barely visible. When a player comes by it makes a rush. When moving it&#039;s white. <br><br>While the other lizards benefit from searching an area where they&#039;ve lost a player, the white lizard is better of staying still and waiting, because the longer it stays blended the easier you forget where it is. This means that the white lizard will be considerably less persistent in pursuing you, it will instead give up pretty quickly when it loses visual contact and instead go back to stealth mode.<br><br>Hopefully this will bring some fun variety to the game, if not it might be thrown out or changed.

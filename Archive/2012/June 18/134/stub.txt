<b>Update 60</b><br>For some reason I decided to re-open the huge can of worms that is the croc AI. As those of you who have played the alpha might know, there&#039;s a weird quirk where if a croc spots you, it doesn&#039;t turn towards you but instead hurries off in another direction, making a huge detour before finally arrive to the place you were once at.<br><br>This is because I had the following system set up: The paths are calculated from the goal position towards the croc. When the path reaches the croc, a new path is started up, with whatever new place is the croc&#039;s target as a source. <br><br>This meant that when a croc saw you, it would first of all continue calculating how to get to some random place on the map it was headed for, start off in that direction, <i>then </i>start to calculating how to get to you (quite often while literally outrunning it&#039;s own thought process by moving in the opposite direction faster than the pathing could catch up with it), then turn around and try getting to you. <br><br>An easy solution for this, which is now implemented, is that upon spotting a player the target position is reset. With this new behaviour a croc that was previously idle or searching, which now spots a player, will stop in its tracks for a second to calculate how to get to you, and then set off.<br><br>The problem with <i>this </i>however, was that during a hunt the player will appear and dissapear repetedly from the croc&#039;s view, and when the croc resetted its pathing process every time it spotted a player it didn&#039;t get very far at all. Finally this was solved, by making it so that this stuff only applies to a croc that is actually changing from idle behaviour to hunting behaviour. <br><br>As a part of looking at the AI again I noticed that a croc that has lost track of a player will investigate the area <i>two </i>times instead of one, which isn&#039;t very good as a search like that might take upwards 30 seconds, and two of them might mean that a croc is confined to a small area more or less for the rest of the game.<br><br>I have an idea of what&#039;s causing this, and will look into it tomorrow.<br><br>Furthermore, the arms are coming together. I had to make three animations like the one above, because the arm needs to be able to rotate... inwards so to speak, but I think that it right now looks OK, or at least has the potential to look OK.

James is an awesome artist who has made the score for several famous games, and I&#039;m much looking forward to what he&#039;ll bring to the project. Check out his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141219150456/http://jamesprimate.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">page</a>! <br><br>At this point it looks like James will not only make the music, but also the sound effects for the game. He sent me an amazing sounding sketch, and I have sent him a beta version of the game. <br><br>This feels great, because as I&#039;ve mentioned sound is really one of my weaker spots. The work I had done up until now I felt was just passable, but with someone who&#039;s really good dedicated to it I think it&#039;ll be not only passable, but a really good element that will add to the game.<br><br>Of course it&#039;s scary to let a part of the project out of my direct control, but it&#039;s a leap of faith that will likely bring a lot of good stuff. Now this part can develop more independently, and hopefully the whole will end up greater than the sum of the parts in a way that wouldn&#039;t be possible if I did everything myself. I&#039;m much looking forward to seeing where this goes!<br><br>Welcome James! Say something to introduce yourself!<br><br><b>Update 84</b><br>Thank you people for your attention!<br><br>Once again I&#039;ve been wrestling the seemingly (to me) impossible task of capturing and uploading a video. Stuff just will not work. Finally I managed to get a .avi file, but it&#039;s uncompressed and too big to upload. I also have an .swf, but that one got some buggy lines in it when I uploaded it. Once again I simply got too tired of it and decided to quit, but if anyone has any tips of how capturing video and uploading it can be done they&#039;re very welcome to tell me <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141219150456im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/tired.gif" alt="Tired" border="0"><br><br>In other news there has been a little progress here and there, as usual. There&#039;s now a very simple function for making cracks in walls, so that you can make a passage while at the same time conveying that a structure was actually meant to look in another specific way. For example if you want to make a level that has two identical pipes at each side, but want the player to be able to pass through one but not the other, you can use the function to create a crack through one of the pipes. It&#039;ll then be passable, while it will still be conveyed that it was meant to look like the other pipe. It doesn&#039;t look awesome, but it does the job.<br><br>Also started to get back to the game engine for the campaign game mode. This needs to be finished in order to get to the long promised building of the actual world that we should be getting to soon now, I hope.

Hehe that sounds about right then, only that I&#039;d like BIGGER worn down mysterious things!<br><br>I have waaay too much work right now - it&#039;ll get better next week. However I&#039;ve been able to do at least something:<br><br><b>Update 106</b><br>I&#039;m into another assault on what I think might be one of the games&#039; biggest design flaws - that you can&#039;t really know where a shortcut will take you unless you&#039;ve made the level yourself. Earlier I added a little spark that flows through the shortcuts so that you at least have a chance to see them, now I&#039;ve started on another cue as well. Instead of drawing the shortcut symbols onto the level image, I&#039;ve made them separate sprites. Next up is making them blink or change color when a player is close to them, in a similar manner to items on the ground.<br><br>The trick is that they&#039;ll change color in pairs, so that you can see which of all the exits is blinking when you get close to an entrance, and from that conclude where you&#039;ll end up.<br><br>After this I&#039;ll move on to more important but boring stuff I figure, such as... the main menu -.-

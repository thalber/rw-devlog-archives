Thank you very much!<br><br><b>Update 122</b><br>I found my map, and transfered it to a bigger sheet of paper. When looking at the map I realized that the single player campaign only has 7 levels, which is very limited compared to the like 40+ levels I&#039;ve actually already made. So I decided to cram a few more of them into the single player world - it&#039;s a very small effort required and it will make the single player longer, giving me time to in peace and quiet introduce each color of lizard without rushing anything. So, now I&#039;m well into extending the world map. Don&#039;t worry though, I won&#039;t make it too huge for me to handle. If I add maybe five hub rooms I&#039;ll have room for three or four additional swarm rooms, making the game 50% longer without much additional work.

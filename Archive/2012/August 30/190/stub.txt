Thanks JLJac! These guys know me, I&#039;ll let the music do the talking ;]<br><br>If you&#039;ve been following along, you know that the game is a fairly brutal struggle for survival set in the dilapidated ruins of a post-apocalyptic city. You play as a small creature searching for food in between torrential downpours, dodging the hazzards of the local flora, perpetually hunted by vicious creatures.&nbsp; <br><br>From my perspective, the music needs to both set the emotional tone of the protagonist animal and immediately describe the fascinating world that JLJac has created. This is a start to that. The ambiance, sfx and music will of course be separate assets in the actual game, but with this I wanted to convey the overall &quot;sound experience&quot; that I have envisioned. Hope you enjoy!<br><br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141219150456/http://soundcloud.com/james_primate/rain-world-ambiance-sketch" target="_blank">http://soundcloud.com/james_primate/rain-world-ambiance-sketch</a>

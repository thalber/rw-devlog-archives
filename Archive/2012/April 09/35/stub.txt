<b>Update 17</b><br><br>Made the croc able to kill the player. Not eat, that&#039;s a matter of animation and will be attended to later, but magically kill on touch. The croc is now able to lash out to a close by player, making it impossible to jump over it on a floor. <br><br>As I mentioned the croc is already slower than you out on open floors, and that together with you being able to jump and it only being able to turn made it possible to jump over its head again and again for ever. The new mechanic means that you can&#039;t do that any more. You can still jump over it by using a wall though.<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129224152im_/http://oi41.tinypic.com/1255dza.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Almost all the mechanics I imagined for the game are in now, but there&#039;s a lot of number tweaking to do. However, I feel that I&#039;m finally at the end of the huge chunk of this project that has been the croc AI, and hopefully no other part will take as much time. There will be a revisiting to this though, when I have a little less schoolwork to do so I can try the game out with a friend. I have no idea how the crocs handle multiple players, it could be just fine, it could be in need of some redesign. <br><br>It&#039;s too hard to cath the A-creatures, need to tweak that a bit. Another thing I was thinking of was that maybe the player shouldn&#039;t eat the creatures on touch, but rather just catch them, and then you have to go find a safe place to consume your prey. I like this idea, will have to see how it plays out in reality. <br><br>Been thinking a lot lately about how I will render levels. Have some kind of semi-voxel idea going on, more on that later. However, with level rendering comes art, and with art the devlog becomes interesting! Hopefully the daily five page essays on how a virtual lizard finds its way around a maze has finally come to an end... A brighter future awaits!

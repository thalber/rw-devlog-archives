<b>Update 18</b><br><br>Moved the level rendering code over to the level editor, and overhauled it completely. The system is now working in a semi-voxel kind of way, where one tile is 20*20*10 pixels. I also made the level editor able to save a level in the format that I think will be final. Didn&#039;t try loading yet though... The level seems to be very light, so I&#039;m happy about that.<br><br>The voxel format allows me to do some interesting stuff such as fog and light...<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129224152im_/http://oi41.tinypic.com/21bvq4w.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br><br>This is just 20 minutes of coding to test it, but I like the potential it has. Because of the voxels I don&#039;t have to create separate solutions for everything, stuff sorts itself out automatically. If you look at the detail in the lower right corner maybe you can imagine what a hassle it would be to calculate how the shadows would look in every special case like this, now it just works by itself.<br><br>It&#039;s flawed, yes, I have noticed the stripy floors. Also it will demand some patience, rendering it pixel by pixel will take a minute or two for an entire level. But I see a lot of potential in it!<br><br>

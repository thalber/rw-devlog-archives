<b>Update 74</b><br>Boring but very necessary work today. Started on some kind of main menu that holds the level editor together, from where you can load and save level projects and access the different editors.<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20200806012324im_/http://oi48.tinypic.com/kngqx.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br><br>This has been needed for a long time, but I&#039;ve neglected it because I&#039;ve been able to work around it. Now I&#039;m getting to it as I can no longer make levels from scratch, I need to be able to save a level editor project as some kind of file, so I can return to it later and make changes. Once this is done it will finally be worth it to start making levels for the world, knowing that if I need to make changes of any kind that won&#039;t necessarily mean building the whole thing from scratch again.<br><br>As always when working with user interfaces the progress is painful and slow, but now I at least have some basic buttons up and running. For the first time ever you can add some tiles in the tile editor, then change your mind about some geometry stuff and go back and change it, then return to the tile editor again. In this case you&#039;d likely have to clean up some tiles that are hanging in the air or otherwise occupying illegal positions, but it&#039;s a lot better than not being able to at all.

<b>Bad news</b><br>I got to know today that I&#039;m in a bit of a tight spot concerning certain school work. This means that for a week or two, I will have to focus on that. The game will have to be put on ice.<br><br>Note however that I&#039;m not abandoning the project forever or for an indefinite amount of time. Within two weeks I&#039;ll be back on track. Maybe this isn&#039;t the worst time for this to happen, the alpha is released which was a huge mile stone for the project, and now feedback has started to get back to me. In a couple of days when I look at the project again I might be able to do so with fresh eyes, and by then I will have quite a lot of feedback to fall back on as well. Those of you who have an alpha, please let me know what you think! I will have time to read it.<br><br>So, a short break. See you in a few days, wish me luck!

Actually, the longer the detour is the longer it will take for it to find a path, meaning that you&#039;ll get a little bit of it moving back and forth contemplating on its next move.<br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141225144916/http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.msg803746#msg803746">Quote from: Six on October 15, 2012, 09:50:17 PM</a></div><div class="quote">Isn&#039;t this just an issue of player feedback, though? Lots of games (and especially stealth games!) suffer from this same problem of the player not being aware of the AI state.<br></div>The problem here is that psychological phenomena which I don&#039;t know the name for in english, animism perhaps, that you want to play <i>with </i>rather than <i>against</i>. The thing I&#039;m thinking of is the tendecy for humans to read more intelligence into the behaviour of dead objects than there actually is. <br><br>For example, a human dropping a marble that rolls in under some furniture might think that it &quot;hid&quot; in there, even though it most certainly didn&#039;t because it&#039;s a dead object and it only followed simple mechanics. The psychology behind this is obviously the magic behind computer game characters seeming to come alive.<br><br>My theory (as an amateur) is that the more you are aware of the mechanics behind a behaviour, the less you&#039;ll submit to the feeling that the object is alive. A while back I posted a video where some lizards were moving around, and got this response:<br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141225144916/http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.msg750714#msg750714">Quote from: Franklins Ghost on June 21, 2012, 10:15:51 PM</a></div><div class="quote">...and the way he stood above you with his mouth open was a great little characteristic. Amazing job...<br></div><br>I remember this because Franklins Ghost had obviously thought that the lizard opened its mouth as a way to display frustration over the player being out of reach. I knew why the lizard opened its mouth (boring technical reason) but kept quiet, as the other interpretation was more awesome and fun. In this case not knowing what was going on behind the scenes created a more awesome experience.<br><br>So, I think that if I create a window into the lizards&#039; heads I would also compromize them feeling like creatures, and make them feel more like mechanics. Their inner lives can never be half as complex as what we fill in the blanks with when we don&#039;t know what&#039;s going on, which is why I keep the not knowing what&#039;s going on as high as possible.<br><br>I have been thinking about symbols such as (!) and (?) though, and actually have implemented something along those lines. As a lizard is surprised its head vibrates a little and it emits some particles, which is usable as a cue that the lizard has seen you or heard you. Then again I don&#039;t know how well this actually works, as when I myself am playing I&#039;m also aware of all the nuts and bolts behind the scenes.<br><br><b>Update 101</b><br>Caught a cold, and has mostly been horizontal on different surfaces today. The only thing keeping me from complete uselessness has been a sketch for how the main menu could be laid out.

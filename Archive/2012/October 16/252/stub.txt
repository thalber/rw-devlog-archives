Hahaha that review was down to each word exactly what I wanted to hear &gt;_&lt; Even the &quot;different personalities&quot; thing was in there! Hopefully it&#039;s because the game is becoming what it&#039;s supposed to, and not because James knows too much about the project haha!<br><br>A sneak peak under the hood: They emit particles either because they hear a sound, because the&#039;ve spotted you (a lot if they weren&#039;t aware of you, a small burst if they were already chasing you but didn&#039;t know exactly where you were) or because they&#039;re taking sticks and stones to the face. Maybe they do it when fighting over prey as well, don&#039;t remember.<br><br>There are other subtle ways of reading a lizard&#039;s mind as well - a slowly pulsating head means it&#039;s calm and idle, a quick change in color means it&#039;s hunting and somewhere inbetween means it&#039;s cautious or searching. Black eyes means it doesn&#039;t see you, sparkling eyes mean it&#039;s currently seeing a player.

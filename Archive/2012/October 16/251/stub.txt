speaking as &quot;the other person who has played rain world pretty extensively&quot;, I&#039;d like to throw my 2 cents into the AI chat. I certainly don&#039;t know what&#039;s going on under the hood, but the lizard behavior is quite unpredictable in a very cool way. It&#039;s hard to describe, but sometimes during a chase they will seem to anticipate your movements based on the level structure, then get distracted by snapping at flies, then mope around, then &quot;hear&quot; you and start stalking again. it&#039;s quite believable for neon death lizards. also, different favors of lizard (red green blue white, etc) all have their own fairly distinct personalities and behaviors, so when you get a couple of flavors in a level chasing you around you have NO idea what&#039;s going to happen and it&#039;s quite scary and chaotic, which I think is exactly the right vibe for the game.<br><br>fwiw, I had no idea that the jiggling particle head meant that it had heard you (I was assuming rage or aggravation or something? They often do that when I spear them in the face, heh heh), but I LIKE that element of unreadability where you can&#039;t tell if they are laying in wait for you or don&#039;t have a clue.. Having a more standard &quot;!!&quot; &quot;??&quot; sort of thing might be take away a bit of that in my most humble of opinions.

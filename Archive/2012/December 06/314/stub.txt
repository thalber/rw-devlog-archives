I got an email from James, and suddenly realized that it&#039;s been waaaaay to long - so, here I am again.<br><br><b>Update 119</b><br>Finalized the lizard-egg interactions. A lizard will now behave reasonably if you steal its egg, and the AI seems to not mess upp too much (from what I&#039;ve seen so far). <br><br>If you steal an egg, the lizard will hunt you down and kill you, but let go and take the egg home first. Then it will return for your body. If you drop the egg to the ground the lizard will prioritize the egg over you, and you&#039;re safe a little while. If you snatch the egg from a lizard that&#039;s carrying it you&#039;re pretty much instantly dead though, as it&#039;ll just snap at you the very moment you snatch the egg. When carrying eggs they have their mouths slightly open, meaning that you don&#039;t even have the few frames it ordinarily takes for a surprised lizard to open its jaws before it can snap at you. A lizard always knows where its egg is, even though it can&#039;t see it. A psychic radio connection? Idk... But if they didn&#039;t, it would be way too easy to get away with an egg, as it is now it at least poses some kind of risk and challenge.<br><br>You don&#039;t need to press the &quot;pick up&quot;-button to get an egg from a hole, entering the hole without carrying anything in your hands will pick up the egg automatically.<br>

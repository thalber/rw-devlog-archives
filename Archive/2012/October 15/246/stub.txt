In my game some of this works pretty well for an experienced player, you can for example do cartoony stuff such as dissapearing behind a corner and then quickly into a side corridor, wait for the lizard to pass by said side corridor, and then exit the same way as the lizard was chasing you. The problem is that you need to be aware that stuff like this is doable in order to do them. For that awareness to occur you&#039;d need to perform it at least 5 times, the first few times you wouldn&#039;t be able to tell it apart from random chance. <br><br>As the game is right now the shaft scenario could very well occur, you could drop down a shaft while visible to a lizard but then grab hold of a metal beam halfway down and dissapear somewhere else, while watching the lizard search the bottom of the shaft. I don&#039;t think of this as an exploit, as this is the way the game is supposed to work.<br><br>The problem in a situation such as this is that in 9 cases out of 10 the quickest way for the lizard to get down into that shaft would be to get to the edge and make the same jump you did. This means that in the majority of the cases the smart action is the same as the dumb action of an AI that just tries to get to the position where it last saw a player. In explaination, in the most cases you won&#039;t be able to <i>see </i>that the lizard is smart, even though it is. There are however cases when you notice the intelligence.<br><br>The funny part is that most of those cases are bad for the lizard. An example:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141225144916im_/http://oi46.tinypic.com/125jcqe.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br><br>You are stranded on the little island, and a stupid AI would just end up waiting below you, as it would move towards you and then end up waiting once it got to a ledge that was too high for it to climb. This is stupid thinking, but the resulting action is smart, as you&#039;d have no-where to go with a lizard waiting below you.<br><br>A rain world lizard, on the other hand, realizes that it can get to you through a detour. The problem is that when it&#039;s inside the tunnel it can&#039;t see the player, and once it reaches the balcony the player has long since dissapeared. <br><br>In this case the more stupid AI would be more successful, because if it just waited below the player wouldn&#039;t have anywhere to go. My point though is that the setup I have now is more <i>fun</i>. A deadlock would just be a deadlock, but a lizard making a somewhat stupid decision is entertaining, because you can <i>see that it makes a decision</i>. Instead of having a stupid AI that ends up catching you because of luck you have a creature that&#039;s thinking, but which you&#039;re <i>outsmarting</i>. Outsmarting things is satisfactory.<br><br>So, the exploits you&#039;re talking about are certainly there, but I&#039;ve kind of built my game around them - they are the main game mechanic. To not make it too easy the lizards are compensated with physical treats - they are fast, has excellent vision and can hear you if you&#039;re not moving carefully. <br><br>When it comes to hyping the AI, I don&#039;t know... Hehe looking at what I wrote above I realize I&#039;m already far down that road, but I don&#039;t want to over do it as raised expectations might make people dissapointed. I&#039;m just a single guy building this on evenings and weekends, and people are used to games devloped by 50 people with a university degree each. That said, I can always emphasize that a high percentage of my hours with this has been put into AI, whatever that is worth.<br><br>Ah, whatever, here we go:<br><b>Update 100</b><br>Let&#039;s celebrate the 100&#039;th update with that the framework for implementing James&#039; music has taken its first solid step. I can now create a list of triggers for hunts that activate, change or deactivate songs on defined events. Today I had one song start, and continue playing until I had caught 4 flies, after which it stopped. Then another song started when I spotted my first lizard, and ended when I entered a specific level. <br><br>It seems to work well enough already! There will be changes though, but I&#039;ll try to stick to my policy and implement new technical solutions as an answer to a need on the art side, rather than just doing stuff that I think I maybe might use.

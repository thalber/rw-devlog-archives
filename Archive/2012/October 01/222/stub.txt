Hm! Is this going to be a multiplayer only thing, or can i flail about on the buttons for a chance to escape the jaws in single player as well?<br><br><br>oh and just for the official record: i AM doing things update ;] 34 minutes of music in usable form and we&#039;re beginning to stitch together background ambiance audio. JLJac&#039;s level design for rainworld is *really* cool in that everything is connected with an underlying logic and many areas can be accessed a few different ways. I would like the ambiance audio to reflect that by thinking of it first as world-wide &#039;geographical regions&#039; with specific sound qualities rather than simple discreet levels. <br><br>Simple example: there are many &quot;high&quot; levels where the protagonist animal is totally &quot;outside&quot; and heavy buffeting wind will be used as an aspect of that sound design. It would be cool if the areas that were geographically close to these &quot;high&quot; levels could still vaguely hear those buffeting winds, etc., etc. So basically, Im looking to create a cohesive sound-world that, in addition to reflecting the specific level design, also gives the player a subtle sonic picture of where they are at in the overall game world.<br><br>or maybe it&#039;ll just sound like a messy garble and suck! we&#039;ll find out<br><br>/audio nerd ramble ramble

THANK YUO!<br><br><b>Update 94</b><br>Making levels, making levels. For the first time like, ever, I&#039;ve done something according to my policy - recognizing a demand for a feature <i>when making a level</i> and then adding it, rather than adding features with abandon and then trying to cram them into the levels. The feature in question is the ability to mark a tile as forbidden for flies to swarm, form chains or hang around unecessarily on. A level I made had a room that was only accessable to flies, and quickly turned very boring when all the flies decided to just hang out in that one room (why shouldn&#039;t they, right?). Also made it possible to mark tiles for spawning flies on level startup.<br><br>Have been working with a lot of juicy palettes and light options as well. The idea that the game will be monochrome is given up, it will have pretty vibrant colors actually. I&#039;m eager to show you some of the stuff, but at the same time don&#039;t want to spoil the whole game in here. Soon I&#039;ll give you something though, I just want to have enough material to feel that whatever I&#039;m giving away is not a substancial part of it.

To at least give you something today, here&#039;s a bit of concept art. Some parts I&#039;m happy with, others not.<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141212170251im_/http://oi49.tinypic.com/2wh2har.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br><br>I&#039;m happy with the... face, not the head but the face. The way the head ends needs work. The body in general needs to be less anatomically realistic. I want the face to be more emotionless, I think, like a mask that looks like something that could be a biological part of the creature but could as well be added on. It needs to work better together with how the Bear looks...<br><br>Well, as you can see there&#039;s a lot that will change, this is just a rough sketch. The technical implementation will also have a <i>huge </i>impact, that likely won&#039;t increase or decrease quality, but just change everything fundamentally. My original sketches for the Bear looked like *deep breath* THIS:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141212170251im_/http://oi49.tinypic.com/j93u35.jpg" alt="" border="0"> <br>And ended up like this: <br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141212170251im_/http://oi45.tinypic.com/ljrr7.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br><br>So the technical implementation phase can do good things as well...<br><br>We&#039;ll have to see where it goes! This is an interesting part of making games, technical solutions and limitations bring something unpredictable to your art process, and if you go with that stuff might end up somewhere unexpected.<br>

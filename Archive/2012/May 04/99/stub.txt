I had a fat deadline for school today, and have sadly not been able to work on the game. Now in the afternoon I&#039;ve started to play a little with the level editor, to put some levels together for the alpha. Maybe it won&#039;t be released within <i>the </i>week as promised, but within <i>a</i> week it should be out.

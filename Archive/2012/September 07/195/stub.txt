thanks guyssssssss! Im really stoked, this is going to be a great.<br><br>Looks like things are shaping up! Been talking back and forth with JLJac and the levels look pretty structured. For sound stuff, we&#039;re stitching ambiance stuff together and I&#039;ve got a few tracks together that sound nice and cohesive. But I just spent like 2 days working on a new piece that Im really excited about...&nbsp; and it totally isn&#039;t going to fit the gameplay haha. OH WELL, BONUS CONTENT!

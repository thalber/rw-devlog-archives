<b>Update 22</b><br>I think I finished the shadow renderer today, hopefully to never return to it. The game still looks bad, but now I think I have the tools to start fixing that. However, my entire level renderer is messed up at this point, it doesn&#039;t even render the slopes. Well well, two steps forward one step back. Hopefully I will get around to support for tile sets some time soon.<br><br>It&#039;s nice to see how the different part of the game work independently, when I open one of my new levels to see how it looks ingame the croc&#039;s AI navigates through the new environments with ease - obviously, as the level is mathematically the same, but still nice to see.<br><br>Today I also did some thinking on the game&#039;s overall concept, the reason why the player does what it does and how the world the game is set in will work. I&#039;ll give you some of this together with some art at a later point, ideas always sound cooler with some tasty art to go with them.

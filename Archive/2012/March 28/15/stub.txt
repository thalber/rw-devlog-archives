Yeah, was also thinking about that, but I think showing the reachable areas in the level editor would ruin the illusion that the croc is actually thinking by itself, if you saw it all laid out like that... We'll see...<br><br><b>Update 4</b><br>Made the user able to place croc holes in the level editor and made crocs spawn at those holes. <br><br>Made a humble little start in the direction of mapping which areas are accessable from a specific hole. The goal is that in this situation<br><br><img src="./Project Rain World_files/35i7trn.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br><br>the croc (here represented by the three big dots) will <i>not </i>pursue the player further, as if knowing that it'd just get trapped at the bottom of the pit. That goal is however not reached yet haha!<br><br>This is especially important because of the very different movement mechanics of the Bear and the Croc. It's not that the Bear is always much more mobile, a wall climbing Croc can often reach areas unaccessable to a Bear, but the ability to jump creates some situations where a Bear can pass an obstacle that's impossible for a Croc.<br><br>This means that some levels could easily contain traps, where you let a Croc chase you to a place from which you're able to get out, but it is not. This wouldn't be fun, as constantly being chased is an important part of the game. Tricking a croc should buy you some time while it's trying to figure out a new way to get to you, not immobilize it for ever. So I think it's worth it to make the Croc do a little extra thinking to avoid that kind of stuff.

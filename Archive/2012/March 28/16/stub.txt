Weird, something seems to be wrong with tigsource&#039;s server... Anyway<br><br><b>Update 5</b><br>I&#039;m happy with today&#039;s progress. I finished the mapping of accessable areas for the croc. The method is that I first map all the tiles that are reachable, then I map all the tiles that the hole is reachable from, and the overlap of those is the active area for that hole. <br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210224131114im_/http://oi43.tinypic.com/2monzps.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br><br>In this pic the blue areas are areas <i>from which I can get home</i>, while the red areas are areas I <i>can get to from home</i>. The platform at the top left is blue, because from here you can drop down to the rest of the map but there&#039;s no way to get there. The pit at the bottom of the map is red, because you can drop down here but not get back up again. Green areas are both reachable and returnable from, and it is this that&#039;s the croc&#039;s active area.<br><br>You can&#039;t really see the hole itself, but it&#039;s there in the middle structure. If I remove the climbable pole connecting the structure to the floor the entire floor becomes red, and the croc will keep only to the central structure, knowing that it won&#039;t be able to get home if it drops down.

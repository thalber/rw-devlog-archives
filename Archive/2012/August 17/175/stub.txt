Thanks! The way I animate things is by a combination of pixel animation and a vector animation. I don&#039;t remember how much detil I go into, but there is some stuff on animation back there.<br><br><b>Update 79</b><br>We&#039;ve got spears! Since the early stages when I had only animated the bear character, and the setting was more jungle/temple-ish, I had always imagined the character as spear wielding. So I added it, and it seems to work OK with this setting as well. <br><br>The spear is thrown in the same way as the rocks, but is much more powerful. Most of the lizards will retreat back into their holes after one hit, possibly taking your spear with them if you don&#039;t run up to them and pull it out again. Players are killed instantly. Now the lizards have a health meter, and can die. In most cases you won&#039;t see this though, as they flee way before they&#039;re close to dying.<br><br>The red lizard, which is the persistent one, never gives up chasing you no matter how messed up it is. I had a pretty epic fight with one, where I several times threw the spear at it, then quickly jumped on it and pulled the spear out before it got out of its stun. Different lizards can take different amounts of abuse, and the red one is of course the toughest. <br><br>The health meter means you can make a lizard retreat by bombarding it with rocks, but that would take quite some time even if you&#039;re two people doing it.

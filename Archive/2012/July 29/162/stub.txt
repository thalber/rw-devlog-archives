<b>Update 73</b><br>Feature creep monday!<br>There&#039;s now a new and pretty fun element in the game. There are pebbles that you can pick up and throw. <br><br>Holding the pebbles is tied in with the same framework as holding flies, so you can hold two pebbles but then you can&#039;t hold any flies, and carrying around one pebble you can only catch one fly.<br><br>Pebbles can be thrown at other creatures. The lizards respond quite differently to this depending on size, the big green is barely affected, while the blue one which is the smallest in the family is tossed like a rag doll for a few frames, and then needs some time to recover. Other players and flies are of course affected too.<br><br>When a pebble hits a wall it makes a sound that can be heard by lizards.<br><br>Maybe I&#039;ll add a few different versions, such as something made out of glass that can be heard all across the level but only has one use, or something sharp that makes a lizard flee back to its hole. It&#039;s easy and fun to work with this stuff.<br><br>You will never be able to actually kill a lizard, because that would undermine them as being dangerous and put them in the &quot;enemy&quot; category, but at least you&#039;re now able to fend them off and buy yourself half a second. Actually I think you can kill them now, with a well placed shot exactly as they are climbing across a gap, but that would be very hard to do.

Oh, the AI, my favourite subject! Actually I think that (in my case) it works the opposite way as what you describe. I haven&#039;t really found any obvious exploits, but rather have a problem where things aren&#039;t working out very well in <i>the beginning</i> of the game.<br><br>It&#039;s hard to sound humble when saying this, but I think that a player that&#039;s just introduced to the game will not really understand how complex the AI is, and because of that the game will work less satisfactory. Just a thing such as understanding that a lizard isn&#039;t always aware of where you are and pathing towards you takes some time to pick up, and the more complex stuff, such as &quot;the last thing the lizard saw before I dissapeared behind those blocks was me falling downwards, and because of that it&#039;ll assume that I fell to the bottom of this shaft, which I can use to anticipate its behaviour&quot; is hard to use even for me, even though I know that it&#039;s there and how it works. <br><br>I&#039;m sure that many people will put the game down quickly thinking &quot;it&#039;s just random and quirky and too hard&quot;, but my hope is that if you don&#039;t do this the game will grow on you. <br><br>So to answer this:<br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141225144916/http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.msg802548#msg802548">Quote from: mes on October 12, 2012, 04:12:41 PM</a></div><div class="quote">advanced character AI in a platformer is something i&#039;ve been interested in trying myself, so i&#039;m curious to see how it turns out here. it seems like a double edged sword, making the game feel deeper and more believable at first, but having the potential to reduce the gameplay to exploitation of its intricacies in the end. looks like you&#039;re well aware of this danger though!<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141225144916im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/wizard.gif" alt="Wizard" border="0"><br></div>I think that the case with my game would be the opposite, that at first it could seem glitchy and weird, but later it will become more deep and and believable.

Do you just lose, or does the rain actually come down and kill you? Can you get knocked around a bit by the first drops of rain and just barely make it into your hole?<br></div>The rain is kind of abstracted in a slightly more game-ey way, there&#039;s a little game over scene where everything suddenly turns black and silent and then the rain hits very suddenly. Of course it would be even cooler to have the rain build up slowly, but it&#039;s hard to display rain in the actual world as objects that would move according to common sense are actually static. The current solution is one of my favourite parts of making games, having to make art and technicalities meet. I&#039;ll make it look cool, promise!<br><br><b>Update 99.8.6.1</b><br>James and I are doing a little contract talk, which we should&#039;ve gotten to way earlier. We&#039;re both aware that the game most likely won&#039;t make any money, but in the case it does we want to make sure that everything is as fair as possible. This is of course boring, but it&#039;s best to get it done as soon as possible. <br><br>In other news I&#039;ve been wrestling a sudden drop in frame rate, which I have not fully identified but which could possibly have more to do with the latest vista update and my computer being old than with the actual game. Old versions lag too, which indicates that some of it might be in the computer, but new versions lag slightly more, which indicates that it&#039;s in the game. The frame rate flails wildly up and down, which makes it hard to get a good understanding of whether it&#039;s high or low.<br><br>Other than thgis I&#039;ve started to contemplate on how to implement the music, and has started to set up a fairly complicated system of triggers for how songs could be activated and deactivated. We&#039;ll see where it ends up.<br><br>James sent me a new batch of ambient sounds, named &quot;the weird batch&quot;, and they are awesome! Those are more abstract than the previous ones, and will help create a mood rather than add realism. Soon I&#039;ll get to implementing ambient sounds, it&#039;s very low hanging fruit at this point.<br><br>Added the ability to spear flies. Working a little with the blur effects, there&#039;s too much of them in some palettes which is a problem, and I might need to kill my darlings and get rid of them.

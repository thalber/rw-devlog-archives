That&#039;s a good idea! If it&#039;s needed I&#039;ll implement it, I think it won&#039;t be though, because as a room is loaded the player will be in shortcut-mode half a second or so before popping out in the actual room, and during this time you&#039;ll have nothing else to look at except the fly.<br><br>This is a balance act for me. The feeling I want to create is a sort of &quot;law of the jungle&quot; thing, where there is a world and it&#039;s painfully obvious that no other entity than you yourself care about your survival. Like, there&#039;s no deus-ex machina leading you along, but staying alive is very much your own responsibility and failing is a very real risk. I think that in games like that it&#039;s much more satisfying when you actually do manage something, because you know that you did it yourself. Think for example of the difference between defeating an AI enemy and defeating another player in a game - online you know that you weren&#039;t favoured in any way and that makes it feel more awsome.<br><br>Guess what I&#039;m trying to say is that if the player isn&#039;t very observant, they&#039;re welcome to die and then be more observant the next time&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20200806012324im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/evil.gif" alt="Evil" border="0"><br><br>On the other hand, it has to be playable... So yeah, balance act.

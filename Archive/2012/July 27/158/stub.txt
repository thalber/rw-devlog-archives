<b>Update 71</b><br>Ok, so the world is divided into hub rooms and hive rooms or whatever you want to call them, rooms you pass through and rooms where the flies are. I don&#039;t really want to include a map, but I still need to somehow lead the player towards a hive room that is currently swarming, as you won&#039;t have time to go check them all. <br><br>What I&#039;ve started working on today is that when you enter a hub room, you&#039;ll see a fly dissappearing into one of the exits leading to another room. If you follow it, it will eventually lead you to the closest swarming hive room.<br><br>This has required some work, becuase there needs to be a little bit of inter-level path finding going on. It has been managable though, as I don&#039;t really want flies actually moving around through the world. Instead I can do this inter-level pathing stuff just once when loading a new room and then spawn one single fly that is very close to the exit. The idea is that you shouldn&#039;t be able to catch it, just see where it goes.

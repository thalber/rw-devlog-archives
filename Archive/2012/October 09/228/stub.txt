<b>Update 99</b><br>Making levels making levels making levels.<br>I&#039;ve more or less created the entire world in dull grey placeholder graphics, and now realize that the world needs to be extended a little bit. This is a great victory, as it means I for the first time ever planned something a little too small rather than vastly too big! My plan is to finish what I have so that it&#039;s more or less ready for release, and then carefully add the stuff that I want without letting feature creep get a hold of me.<br><br>More excitingly I&#039;ve started to experiment with James&#039; stuff, music and ambient sounds. It&#039;s awesome! <br><br>James and I are now contemplating on how the music will be implemented - the setup makes it hard to go with a conventional &quot;one song per area&quot; solution, and it&#039;s also hard to tie songs to events as there&#039;s not really any fixed narrative in the game. The jukebox needs to be somewhat aware of what&#039;s going on, and at the same time be able to surprise the player and not just be playing all the songs on shuffle. It&#039;s a challenge!

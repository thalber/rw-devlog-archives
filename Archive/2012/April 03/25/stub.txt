Yeah, I hope you will be able to play with it in interesting ways. Right now you can do some stuff like dissapearing around several corners quickly, and watch how it gets confused and searches around for you, it&#039;s pretty fun.<br><br><b>Update 11</b><br>Made the croc aware of when it has reached... eh, like, the destination of an old path that it follows until the new path is calculated... well, I made the croc not turn around again and again on the same spot.<br><br>Also I kind of identified and fixed (?) a path finding error that I&#039;m not really even able to formulate for myself... The code is too extensive and complicated for me to fully understand at this point, but it seems to be working OK. Seems like a tile can&#039;t be weighted more than a passage between tiles, but if this is an inherent feat in the A* mathematics or something I messed up is beyond me. As long as I keep it in mind it shouldn&#039;t be a problem.<br><br>Made variable speeds for the croc depending on what it&#039;s doing, so that it&#039;ll speed up when chasing you and slow down when just roaming around.<br><br>EDIT: Solution came to me in the shower. Implementing tomorrow!

Hi there! <br><br>Yep, you got it. If a limb ends up too far behind the body, it extends forward looking for a new point to reach for. It&#039;s kind of a shame because this is exactly what I focused the GDC talk on, but as the videos require a $1k pass to view and I signed a paper not to spread anything, I think it&#039;d hardly be popular if I brought it out in the open :/ I&#039;ll give you a short version right here though!<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308165822im_/https://giant.gfycat.com/WideShadyBee.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>So here you see a creature (Daddy Long Legs) moving through an environment. The yellow dots hovering are &quot;ideal grab positions&quot; - if all positions in the room were valid grab positions this is where the tentacles would prefer to grab on. As you said, they are in front of the creature with respect to the body&#039;s general movement direction - if you&#039;re climbing you want to get your limbs in front of you, in order to pull yourself forward. <br><br>However, not every position in the room is a valid grab position, because it shouldn&#039;t be able to grab on to thin air. That&#039;s what I use this three-tier system for:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308165822im_/https://zippy.gfycat.com/ColorfulPreciousFlatcoatretriever.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Yellow dot is still the ideal grab position. Green dot is the &quot;temporary grab position&quot;. What happens here is that I have a method that can assign a score for each position in the room, evaluating how good of a grab position it is. If the position is thin air, the score is negative infinity or something - you never want to grab on to here. If the position is on the surface of terrain though, the score is higher the closer it is to the yellow dot. <br><br>So, each frame the leg locomotion algorithm picks a random position in the room. If the random position has a higher score than the current temp position (green) the temp position is moved to the random position. This means that the outcome in a specific frame can only be a) not moving or b) moving to a better position - making sure that over the course of several frames, the green dot will gravitate towards the best possible valid position. <br><br>And finally we have the blue dot, which is the &quot;current grab position&quot; - where the limb is actually headed. <br><br>So the cycle goes like this: Blue dot (current grab position) is placed on top of green dot (temp grab position) and the tentacle moves there, as the body moves along towards its goal. When the tentacle ends up too far behind the body, the tentacle releases and the blue dot is once again put on top of the green dot, which has now progressed further along. Repeat! This creates a cycle of grab, pull forward, release, grab, pull forward, release.

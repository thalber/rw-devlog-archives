<b>Update 511</b><br><br>Long day of working with scavengers movement in abstract space, and in particular between abstract space and realized space. Fought a million issues with them getting stuck, disappearing, becoming a strange ghost scavenger that&#039;s just sitting in the room which you can&#039;t collide with, etc etc etc. Managed to solve <i>most </i>of it.<br><br>They now form little squads, and set out into the world. The squads are kind of loose - they&#039;re not a swarm like the bats. But if you encounter one, you can generally be pretty sure that there are a few more not so far away. The squads also occasionally move on the world map, migrating from one room to another. That&#039;s pretty fun to see, if you lie behind some garbage pile and suddenly see this little caravan of strange looking fellas pop up and go through the room, on their way to some unknown destination. It would be really cool if I managed to fine tune it so that you could secretly follow them. <br><br>I also made it so that they generally spawn with a few spears already on them. Getting the objects to realize properly when they entered real space was trouuuuuuble, but it looks like it&#039;s working and I&#039;m not the one to question that by probing too deep. <br><br>The current problem is that if they pop up more than 5 or so in a room, they get into a cycle where they want to investigate each others&#039; movement sounds and get stuck in a big goofy pile. That sort of problem is more cute than horrifying though, compared to the technical nightmares of abstraction/realization problems, so I&#039;m not worrying about that one. Will take care of it tomorrow!

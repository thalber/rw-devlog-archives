You see their logo at the start here: <br><iframe width="640" height="385" src="//web.archive.org/web/20210308165754if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/tVWPtsSPhzk?fs=1&amp;start=" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br></div><br>Honestly it&#039;s mostly because we&#039;re kind of embarrassed to have a company and avoid putting &quot;our logo&quot; on anything whenever we can. We&#039;re *really* not trying to make some studio brand out of all of this, just Joar and James (and Lydia and Del) makin a game. People know rain world and they know us, and that&#039;s how we like it . Thanks for having our back tho! <br><br>And yes, due to public interest I hereby pledge to release the smudged Area 51 documents to anyone who completed the game!

I always imagined you&#039;d do it in a Duck Game like aproach, aka a room with a few exists, each exit marked with the enigmatic in-game alphabet, but styled to suggest what it does; with a big wide pipe in the middle that&#039;s a &quot;start game&quot; equivalent. Probably wouldn&#039;t avoid some the text though (like resolution switching)...

And that&#039;s an essential part of the game design, sort of? It&#039;s a chaotic world that can be traversed in whatever way the player is able to, but at the same time we need to be able to quickly communicate &quot;to preform a pounce, stand still for a moment then press forward + jump&quot;&nbsp;

<div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote"> For this game I could imagine a &quot;Memory sequence&quot; where the player is a young slugcat and one parents is teaching the skills of life. </div><br><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">&nbsp; this would perhaps mean some kind of pre-game/separate tutorial element where you see another Slugcat moving around, intuitively suggesting that you too can do the same things </div><br>exactly this sort of thing has been considered (and we may further consider!) but it would require an entirely new system for AI creature &quot;puppeting&quot; that would probably not be the best time investment at this point if its just going to be used here. Plus there are a lot of concerns about &quot;scripted&quot; creature behavior: joar has worked very hard to make believably intelligent AI with its own agency, and making scripted creature events that wouldnt compromise this with wooden &quot;acting&quot; or awkward looping behaviors would be very time consuming.<br><br>loooooong story short: some-well executed text could potentially solve all of these problems with very little effort. But were not quite there yet, just thinking about it in the context of a menu mockup for now!<br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308165414/https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?PHPSESSID=3nsup5attlkem4c3ctolac14v0&amp;topic=25183.msg1216391#msg1216391">Quote from: Prinsessa on January 27, 2016, 01:37:29 PM</a></div><div class="quote">If you really need some form of text or icons, the cleanest way might be some introductory area where instructions are floating on the screen (a pit and a thingy saying &lt;X to jump&gt;) that fades out when you pass it. Nothing stops you and you can just run past all these boxes. No cutscenes or dialogues you have to press through or anything.<br></div><br>i completely agree!

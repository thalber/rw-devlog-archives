As James says, it&#039;s partly a question of dev time investment/returns. Learning new moves isn&#039;t a huge part of the game (say that there are 6 or so &quot;special moves&quot; out of which maybe 2 or 3 would need explicit explanations) and making some system that shows you how to do those 3 moves in a text-less way would be some work if it&#039;s to be the same quality as the rest of the game. The other option is to put text on the screen once or twice in the very beginning of the game, which is of course very easy. And when it comes to how we&#039;d like to spend our time (of which there never seems to be enough in a day, month, year, what have you) we&#039;d rather spend that time working on some epic end game set pieces etc that we know will stay with the player and affect them on an emotional level.<br><br>That said, we don&#039;t entirely count &quot;clever&quot; solutions out, so if we get to actually implementing some sort of tutorial and an idea that doesn&#039;t require us going out of our way for two weeks pop up, we grab it!<br><br><b>Update 522</b><br><br>Game has a working menu! It has four buttons, new game, continue, options and exit. Options doesn&#039;t do anything yet. Continue is properly greyed out if there&#039;s no save file in the root folder. <br><br>This is not the final menu set up, but a place holder. Later as we get to the playable pups, I think the &quot;new&quot; and &quot;continue&quot; buttons will be swapped for a button that takes you to a slugcat select screen ~ so you can do that thing with a separate save state for each slugcat which we talked about. <br><br>Everything seems to work! You can start a new game, load a game, start a new game and abandon it and load a game and have your map exploration from that last game wiped, etc. <br><br>Also the menu has gamepad, keyboard and mouse support. Clicking the mouse once puts it in mouse mode, pressing a key or a gamepad button takes it back to keys/gamepad mode.

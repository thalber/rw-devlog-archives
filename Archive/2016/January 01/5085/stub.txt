Yep, I&#039;m into the idea from the art perspective - that&#039;s why it made it to the sketches - just a bit sketchy about the technical implementation. We&#039;ll have to see how it goes!<br><br>Happy new year everyone!

Made it able to swim, and worked quite a bit with making it not get stuck, a standard problem for RW creatures that I&#039;ve dealt with quite a lot before, so I have some go-to solutions by now.<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309211557im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2016/01/01/LIhQX.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>The first problem is to identify <i>when</i> you&#039;re stuck. I do this by collecting a rolling list of the creature&#039;s position each frame - every frame it plops in its position in the first position, and deletes the very last position. Then, also every frame, it goes by all the items in the list and checks how many of them are within a certain distance of the critters <i>current </i>position. If you&#039;re moving that trail should be behind you, but if you&#039;re stuck they will all be up close.<br><br>When you know that you&#039;re stuck there are a few measures you can turn to. One is to stop applying certain forces to the chunks that are supposed to keep the critter in the right posture - such as the force pushing the upper body up and the lower body down to keep you upright. That sort of stuff is a common reason why you&#039;re stuck.<br><br>As the critter is stuck, a counter is increasing. The higher it goes, the more desperate measures I will take. After a while I shrink the collision boxes of the character in relation to the terrain, for example. Another common thing is that the creature will just try to get in the direction it&#039;s getting but <b>harder </b>, ie applying more force in that direction. After a while most creatures will start to wiggle and shake, lots of random forces in different directions tend to shake them lose - but this obviously does not look too pretty, so I apply it pretty late in the &quot;stuck cycle&quot; so that the creature will properly have depleted other options first.<br><br>No gif of this stuff, as it looks pretty horrible&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309211557im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0"> It&#039;s not supposed to be how the creature generally looks, but more of a desperate last resort when they are positively stuck - which they always will get one way or another in this chaotic environment. At the end of the day, it&#039;s looks much uglier that the critter is indefinitely stuck in a corner (as those of you who have played with the alpha vultures might now) than if they wiggle a bit unnaturally and then get lose and can continue doing their thing.

So far so good on audio RAM stuff? Id be interested to see an audit on it though. Theres a few places (huge rooms with tons of stuff going on) where the audio hangs a bit, but joar is confident thats just loading fussiness and is easily fixable. A similar thing happened with the music loading and was fixed without much fuss, so fingers crossed.<br><br>Finally finished with ambience audio! (or at least got it to a reasonable place to move on from...) Didnt take all that long IRL, only 2 weeks, but man in subjective time that was rough stuff. Its the sort of thing thats requires constant steady concentration to fine details over like, hours and hours and thousand screens, so it is *quite* fatiguing both mentally and aurally. <br><br>No rest for the wicked though, as im diving right into finishing up the SFX. There is still a ton of SFX triggers to be placed (once Joar gets done with his current project there will be an afternoon and change devoted to that), but for now at least i can catch up on some of the more recent creatures. And by &quot;recent&quot; i mean &quot;Miros bird and lantern mouse&quot; lol. <br><br>The slog continues!

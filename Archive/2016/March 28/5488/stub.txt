On my end ive been implementing the music, finally. Only took 3 years! Its actually been much more difficult than anticipated. The music was written over such a long period of time and the game has changed so much over that course, the gameplay, mechanics, the look, the scope... so we had to do some killing of the darlings. Out of the 130 or so that had already been written, we selected 80ish that we felt best represented the current Rain World, and I started implementing from there.<br><br>Whats crazy is you might think that 80 tracks would make the world over-stuffed with music, and we did too. Joar even set up a super cool system so that over the course of a number of cycles the music events could change over time, expecting that we&#039;d be layering scenes with different music moods when you return to them later in the game. And in some cases we did, for important narrative scenes, etc., that have some sort of cause/effect, but in general the size of the game is so large that 80 tracks actually feels spread thin! Certain regions totally need more music, so Im busting out the synthesizers and going back in! <br><br>We also have the framework in for a dynamic &quot;threat level&quot; music system (separate from the above, with is more event or location based), where a few layers of music fade in and out depending how how dire the situation is for lil slugcat, so Im going to be experimenting a bit more with that to see if it can be made into a more general audio presence without overwhelming the nice organic ambiance audio.<br><br>Fortunately I have some outside ears this time from my writing partner Lydia who has been doing some theme music for the individual creatures, and thats seriously been invaluable because i never in a million years would have thought I&#039;d need to be writing MORE music at this point. So in roundabout answer to Gimmy&#039;s question, no sleep for me yet! <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308165909im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/coffee-toast.gif" alt="Coffee" border="0"> <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308165909im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/coffee-toast.gif" alt="Coffee" border="0"> <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308165909im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/coffee-toast.gif" alt="Coffee" border="0">

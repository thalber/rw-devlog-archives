yes to all of the above! the planned system has a few different music tiers. there will be a selection of music and atmospheric audio for each region, specific tracks that will be attached to significant rooms for &quot;narrative movements&quot;, and also music that can be attached directly to physical objects or structures in the game, so say as you approach a tower in a wide room the music for that tower fades in as you approach and fades out as you pass, etc. Its going to be the interaction of a couple of different systems, so making it all smooth will probably take some fussing with. Pretty excited though! ive been waiting to do this for a looooong time&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308165504im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/tearsofjoy.gif" alt="Tears of Joy" border="0"><br><br>And heck yeah joars already got that cool lowpass filter effect for going in and out of the water: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308165504/https://youtu.be/ernPmYEg0k0?t=3m56s" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/ernPmYEg0k0?t=3m56s</a><br><br><br>Edit: hey speaking of starbound, do you guys have any other open world-ish games where the music implementation really speaks to you? obviously fez is a big one, and probably one of my biggest influences (talking implementation here) is dark souls.<br><br>Rain World has a lot of unique structural limitations as far as how the music will be used (the periodicity of the rain cycle, the need for sonic &quot;space&quot; to build apprehension, etc), but i could def use to see how other sound designers have solved these problems.

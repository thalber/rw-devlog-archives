But none of this actually makes any sense in that sense - it&#039;s not like the lizards have internet and can share reviews of you or whatever. It&#039;s more like an abstraction for how someone leaving a wake of death would over time be recognized for it, combined with a more game-y dynamic difficulty mechanic. The lizards generally don&#039;t care much if you do bad or good stuff to other lizards, they&#039;re pretty Ayn Rand like that. Scavengers however care a big lot about how they observe you acting towards other scavengers, so an interaction taking place in front of a group of witnesses will basically have a reputation impact multiplied by the number of scavs looking on.<br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308165940/https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.msg1236019#msg1236019">Quote from: Thirteen on April 03, 2016, 04:35:09 PM</a></div><div class="quote"><span style="font-family: tahoma;">I&#039;m 276 pages late, but I power-read through the log, and I must say that your determination is very inspiring, and the game is awesome.

Especially as the interactions I currently have in are mostly towards the negative side, a slow increase from just hanging out seems like a good counter to that.

It will be a selection of individual arena-like rooms, some from the main map and some specifically for multiplayer/ sandbox. region-themed content (creatures and rooms) unlocks as you make your way through the main game. <br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308165441/https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?PHPSESSID=uu92e83irr4j3abf0bd4vqbi51&amp;topic=25183.msg1217012#msg1217012">Quote from: presidenthobbes on January 29, 2016, 07:55:27 AM</a></div><div class="quote"><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308165441/https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?PHPSESSID=uu92e83irr4j3abf0bd4vqbi51&amp;topic=25183.msg1216979#msg1216979">Quote from: JLJac on January 29, 2016, 06:20:56 AM</a></div><div class="quote">As for a &quot;separate tutorial mode&quot;, we have a sandbox mode planned, which will basically be running on the engine of the multiplayer but where you can throw in one player, two players, a player and some creatures you&#039;ve discovered, or just some creatures you&#039;ve discovered and no players at all. So that would both allow for practicing moves in an empty room, practicing a specific creature interaction, or observing interactions between non-slugcat creatures and learning from that.<br></div><br>What is the requirement for &quot;discovering&quot; a creature? Is it just any creature you see or are in the vicinity of, or is there a more complicated system?<br><br></div><br>Not on that quite yet, but initially the idea was a &quot;creature egg&quot; that you have to find and bring back to your den.<br><br>And yes the gladiator mode is suuuuuper fun, even in the old alpha! So I&#039;m really looking forward to it with all the new creatures. It will definitely take some thought on our part to get it to not be a UI/menu hell though.

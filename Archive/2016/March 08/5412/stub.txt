thanks! at this point were probably coasting on past successes though&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308165724im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/cheesy.gif" alt="Cheesy" border="0"><br><br>anyway, heres a recent clip i liked that illustrates the Scavenger&#039;s friend/foe system a little bit:<br><br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308165724/https://twitter.com/RainWorldGame/status/707027795449262080" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/RainWorldGame/status/707027795449262080</a><br><br>this Scavenger has never encountered a Slugcat before, so is initially wary and moves to create distance. when slugcat approaches with a spear, the Scav draws its own spear anticipating a fight, but then as no action is taken by the player, it switches to a less lethal rock. when the vulture comes into view it changes things up a bit, as its considered a much more immediate threat, but you can still see the Scav targeting both the slugcat and the vulture with its spear as the moment to moment threat level changes. but then the slugcat spears the vulture behind the fleeing Scav and you can even see the moment of re-evaluation as the Scav decides &quot;eh alright, youre cool&quot; before they both escape underground as comrades. <br><br>a lot going on in 22 seconds!

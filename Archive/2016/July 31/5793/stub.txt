Any new insights or developments?<br></div><br>Hallo friends! Doing pretty well, thanks for asking~<br><br>It&#039;s been intense on top of intense the past few weeks, but extremely productive. 2 weeks ago Lydia and I flew down to Adult Swim HQ in Atlanta for a solid week of testing, which was very enlightening. <br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308170658im_/https://i.imgur.com/ajHzcVN.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br><br>The way it worked was that we had 2 sessions a day with groups of players who hadn&#039;t played the game before, and we observed how they handled the first 40 or so minutes of gameplay. They&#039;d fill out questionnaires before hand about their experience as a gamer and then afterwards about what they liked / didnt like about the game, what was challenging, what didnt make sense, etc., and then we&#039;d sit around and talk about it for a bit. Then at night, I would take the feedback to Joar (who was still in Sweden naturally) and we&#039;d attempt to iterate a new build that solved some of the problems to test for the NEXT day, etc etc. <br><br>In early testing people always liked the art, mood, characters and sound, but generally found themselves frustrated by aspects or didn&#039;t understand what was going on, or often felt like the game was unfair. Even after playing the tutorial, it seemed to be an issue of the players not understanding how the various mechanics of the game fit together. <br><br>This was a little surprising and humbling for us because we have been showing the game for a long time, both among friends and with new players at conventions like PAX, E3, etc etc., (for years!) and observed people to generally pick it up pretty well. But what seemed to be the X factor at work here was that in those contexts for new players we&#039;d always be standing right there chatting with the player beforehand, and just giving a super brief description when handing them the controller (&quot;its a survival game where you play as this lost creature, have to catch food to survive, rain cycles, etc etc&quot;) was enough to give them the tools to piece together the various mechanics. And obviously a person playing the game blind in a test or downloading it from Steam or whatever, wouldn&#039;t have that. <br><br>And most importantly we had to realize that it wasn&#039;t that &quot;its just not a game for everybody&quot; (as we&#039;d sometimes let ourselves off the hook with), it was actually that we were failing to give players the tools they needed to play the game. NOTHING is worse than watching in front of you someone who is really excited and enthusiastic about your game become frustrated and disillusioned, when 2 seconds worth of text hints or a controller diagram pop up would clarify everything. <br><br>So we had to fix all that. It was intense and stressful! I was working practically 24hrs a day for a good part of the week. But the results were nothing less than paradigm shifting and improved the new player experience (and i&#039;d say the game in general) tremendously. Over the course of the week the tester surveys went from &quot;looks beautiful, but is frustrating or i dont understand&quot; to &quot;i love this, can i play more, when does it come out, let me know if you need deeper testing&quot;, which is *extremely rewarding* <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308170658im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/tearsofjoy.gif" alt="Tears of Joy" border="0"><br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308170658im_/https://i.imgur.com/fumNxdh.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br><br>And after getting back from that we&#039;ve been applying all that we learned from the testing sessions and sprinting to our upcoming <span style="background-color: red;">gold date!</span> Joar has been heroically slaying bugs, polishing gameplay and UI stuff, adding in new features to tie everything up; Del is somehow slogging through an impossible list of illustrations, and im tidying up levels, music, audio and organizing some last bits of deeper testing this week. <br><br>Anyway, we *really really* appreciate you guys still posting and checking in, staying enthusiastic even as we have been mute codeslaves for the past months, too exhausted from the pixel mines to make posts. This will change soon though! The light at the end of the tunnel is so bright I almost feel like Im outside!!!

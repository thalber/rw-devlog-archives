<b>Update 515</b><br><br>It&#039;s going to get a little bit dry here for a bit now. I&#039;m going into a phase of trying to get some base game mechanics down that we never had time for during the creature/region rush. So I&#039;m returning to save states, menus, that sort of stuff. <br><br>Today I split the application into different Main Loops, such as menu, sleep screen and the game itself. Now I&#039;m working with each of them - going for the sleep screen first as that is what will later tie into the save states and inter-cycle progression. Parts of that is already in place, but needs some serious tying together. <br><br>As compensation for the boring, here&#039;s a palette and shader I made for new Sky Islands, of which this is a little sneak peak. James sent me the finished region the other day and it&#039;s looking sooooo pretty. This here is a sky islands interior, ie when crawling inside one of the old structures - the exteriors are contrary sun-bathed and very bright.<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309211642im_/https://giant.gfycat.com/DearTameEchidna.gif" alt="" border="0">

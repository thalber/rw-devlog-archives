thank you, thats good stuff!<br><br>and obviously please note that the 2nd player controls in the alpha are totally borked because we had no idea anyone would ever know about it being there, lol. Clearly having 2nd player gamepad support, a system for room movement and, you know, &#039;not slowing down time by randomly pressing the down key&#039; would be essential elements to the finished product.

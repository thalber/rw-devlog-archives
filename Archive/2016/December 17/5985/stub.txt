Oh hey that&#039;s amazing to hear! Yeah we have co-op built in but it&#039;s going to come later as an update, as we need time to work out some specifics with the implementation. Same for the head-to-head multiplayer.<br><br>Finbonne: I&#039;d love to ask you some questions, as we&#039;ve had like zero player feedback on the co-op. You&#039;re managing to have fun even with the camera only tracking player 1? And how do you handle the room switches? Just wait for the other player to show up before moving on? Literally any info about what you like / don&#039;t like about it will be super helpful.<br><br>We could implement it super quickly as it currently&nbsp; is, having it as a looser &quot;sonic and tales&quot; style co-op where the other player can drift off screen and then warp them in to nearby room exits if they get too far, or perhaps require both players to be in an exit to move rooms. We have also talked about attempting a proper dynamic split screen, when the screens split and recombine, allowing a more serious co-op play-style, but it creates a ton of other problems to solve and might wind up way too CPU intensive with all the shaders that would have to be duplicated onscreen. Plus it doesn&#039;t REALLY work with how the significant game events happen, so idk that might be out at this point. Either way it&#039;ll take some fiddling!<br><br>

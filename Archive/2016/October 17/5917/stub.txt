^ this is a good point that brings up something that we haven&#039;t really talked about much recently. <br><br>the initial concept of the game, which we still believe in to a certain extent, is that it would be something to inhabit rather than &quot;win&quot; per se. the size of the world, complexity of the ecosystem, even the backstory and secrets, are all geared to hopefully make the ingame experience feel unending, self-consistent and &quot;believable&quot;, where theres layers behind layers and you always feel like you could take another turn and discover a whole new world. so hopefully that sense of exploration and discovery is rewarding whether a player sinks in 2 hrs or 20 hrs. <br><br>Ideally what we want is some imaginary midpoint between the intention / art of a hand-crafted experience and the scope of a procedurally generated world. ambitious for sure. foolhardy and likely a terribly inefficient use of development time. but for whatever reason, we were compelled to do it!

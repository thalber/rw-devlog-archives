Still crunching, or have you guys had time for a breather with the release being pushed back?<br></div><br>Hey Christian, thanks for checking in! We&#039;re in a sort of awkward crunch i guess? Past 2 weeks we&#039;ve been waiting for some large-scale testing results to come in and biding our time with finishing up the RW version of &quot;cutscenes and cinematics&quot;, but we just found out that the testing group that ASG was working with sort of flaked out apparently! So now we&#039;re regrouping for another set of tests next week that will be held at Adult Swim HQ in Atlanta and I&#039;ll be flying down to oversee to make sure we get some results.<br><br>This is all testing the tutorial elements and early game stuff, seeing how players who are totally unfamiliar with the game approach problems: if they are understanding the game mechanics and how to progress, etc etc. (Long story short: no, they aren&#039;t) That seems to be the biggest problem we&#039;re having. Players are impressed with the visuals and atmosphere and are having fun, but without being explicitly told what to do they just get lost, die a lot and get frustrated after a while.<br><br>It&#039;s *really* hard stuff for us to understand as developers, having played the game for 4 years and you know, designed every element or whatever, so we&#039;re hoping to iterate a few builds during this week of testing to try a few different concepts on fresh eyes. We&#039;ve been stubbornly refusing to use text cues in the game, but its getting to a ridiculous point where Joar has spent weeks on versions of very cool &quot;holographic&quot; dynamically occurring contextually-dependant tutorial animations and players STILL aren&#039;t understanding, where a simple &quot;press X to jump&quot; text box would solve everything. So... its probably time we acquiesce and just put in some dang text (at least for the tutorial!)<br><br>While all this is going on Del has been finishing up cutscene illustrations, and Joar has been diligently working on wrapping up the ever-expanding list of bugs and events and polish. Right now he&#039;s expanding the interactions with Scavenger society quite a bit, as they are coming into more prominence during the mid-game. (I dont think its really spoiler stuff, so he could probably post about it. I&#039;ll ask him!)<br><br><br>One thing that we&#039;ve sort of been aware of for a while but now is very clear: we basically made the game that we wanted to make, but now have to make several other easier to understand games within that game, because our version of the game is too loose and indecipherable. This isn&#039;t a bad thing at all really, as it means that the finished version is going to be much closer to *actually playable* and so vastly more people will be able to have fun. And none of that takes away from &quot;our game&quot;, which is still 100% there and will exist for high skill players to discover. We&#039;ve created this huge world and there&#039;s plenty of room to fill it with stuff!<br><br>

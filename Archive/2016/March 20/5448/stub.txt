And as we&#039;re talking, another significant mechanic has been implemented - the creature attraction tool. It allows James to tell certain breeds of creatures to be attracted to or avoid certain rooms. This allows him to create little turfs for the creatures that they will <i>generally </i>keep to. Of course we both think that the emergent aspect of rain world is one of the coolest things about it, and we&#039;d in no way want the creatures to be stuck in their spots waiting for the player to arrive like standard video game enemies. This is more about manipulating probabilities - how probable should it be that these creatures are in these general areas? <br><br>Basically it allows to create little mini-biomes within the regions. Garbage wastes for example consists of a large surface area sub region, and then an almost as large system of underground caves. With this system we can create distinct faunas for sub regions like this, while still allowing bleed and overlap and interaction between the two. Just that cave creatures won&#039;t be just as likely to be up on the surface and vice versa. <br><br>Another important aspect of this system is that earlier when creatures roamed the world, they&#039;d have an equal chance to pick any room as a roaming destination, independent of the room size. Having 7 lizards in a 6-screen room is good gameplay, but having 7 lizards in a tiny little one-screen connecting corridor was horrible <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308165822im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/cheesy.gif" alt="Cheesy" border="0"> With this system, the chance to pick a room as a hang out spot is dependent on room size as well, making that latter scenario much less likely. <br><br>It should be noted that the system mostly is manipulating where the creatures choose to <i>stay</i>, they&#039;re still generally allowed to <i>move through</i> any room - making them able to traverse the regions about as much as they previously were (ie a lizard might decide to go hunt 7 rooms away from its spawn position, traversing a third of a region to get there). We do have a &quot;forbid&quot; setting as well that prevents creatures from even passing through a room, but we&#039;re treating that as a &quot;nuclear option&quot; and are very restrictive with its use - mostly using it for keeping Daddy Long Legs from hogging tiny little connecting corridors and blocking player advancement completely. <br><br>In general James has been keeping a very light touch with this tool, keeping things as open and accessible as possible and only going in with slight room attractiveness alterations where it&#039;s really necessary. The changes to how the game plays have been big and for the better though - creatures feel like they have more personality if you can expect them to hang out in certain environments (salamanders like water, for example), and unfair deaths from weird random creature mixtures in tiny rooms has gone down quite a lot.

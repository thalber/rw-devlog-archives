Have you figured out how you will be communicating the karma system in the UI?<br></div><br>Joar has a pretty cool functional UI setup now, but I think it&#039;s going to be stylized / designed up a bit before we show it. Another controversial bit (that historically I have been really against) is that it also incorporates a really slick stylized rain cycle timer. All of it is integrated into the &quot;Slugcat thinking&quot; map screen, so despite all my protesting before, it works really well and is much needed for overall gameplay now that the rain cycle length has randomized elements.

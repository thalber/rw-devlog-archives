(Obviously I&#039;m not expecting full chamber-music dynamics, but perhaps something in the vein of Disasterpeace&#039;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309211802/http://music.disasterpeace.com/album/hyper-light-drifter" target="_blank">exquisitely rendered official score</a> to <i>Hyper Light Drifter</i>, because believe it or not, from what I&#039;ve heard thus far your music really does warrant the extra attention.)<br><br>Thanks in advance, and keep up your truly world-class endeavour in all departments!<br><br>Cheers,<br><br>- Ryan<br></div><br>Most certainly! The soundtrack at this point is absurdly long, like 3.5hr+, a good deal of which is music that is setup in layers for dynamic audio, or other game context dependent format. So after everything is settled with development&nbsp; i really want to take some time and get everything cleaned up, organized or arranged into proper listenable tracks (so it sounds like a song rather than 12 layers of loops that interact etc), and see how it can be grouped into a few albums worth of music.<br><br>We&#039;ve had a few companies come to us with concepts for doing nice vinyl editions and I&#039;d really like to pursue that as well, though 3.5 hours of vinyl is a LOT of vinyl, so might break it down into a few different self contained volumes or something. But yes I&#039;m going to go all out with the music, its going to be fun!

<b>Update 531</b><br><br>Food pt. 3, jellyfish!<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308170132im_/https://giant.gfycat.com/SarcasticBreakableAss.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>The jellyfish float on the surface in shoreline region, behaving perhaps a bit more like a portuguese man-o-war than an actual jellyfish.&nbsp; They are a pretty straight cut food source - you just collect them and munch them down in 3 bites like most other edibles. I did want to add something to make them a little bit more exciting though, so they do have sticky tentacles. The tentacles don&#039;t stick on every collision, but swimming through them there&#039;s a small chance to get tangled. If that happens, the jellyfish acts as a buoy making it harder to dive down, which might be a slight annoyance. After being stuck for a little while the jellyfish will stun you momentarily and then let you go. It&#039;s easy to get away though - just get out of the water, or even just do a swim-jump up above the surface. Or better yet, grab the thing and gobble it down!

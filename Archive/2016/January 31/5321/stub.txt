WOWOWOW things are really really coming together this month. Adult Swim had us on a pretty <del>insane</del> ambitious timeline, and despite literally wanting to die for the past few weeks (i worked 25hr straight yesterday for instance), somehow it all came together for this build. Rain World is now a 100% playable game, with a (gorgeous) menu, saving, progression. First round of polish is done for all 12 regions. Gates are functional and spiffed up with some new visual effects, UI is looking surprisingly good, in-game map is complete and has had some nice polish.

But still it was a pretty big milestone!

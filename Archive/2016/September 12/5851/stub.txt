Things have been *extremely* busy for us the past few months. In addition to continuing to wrap up the dev work, right now Joar is moving to Seoul, South Korea (after spending a week showing RW at Busan Indie Connect, where it was nominated for excellence in Art, Sound and the Grand Prixe prize!) while I&#039;ve been showing the game at PAX West in Seattle (where it was shown at 3 locations: Adult Swim, Sony and Sanshee) and then the XOXO Fest Arcade in Portland for the past 2 weeks. <br><br>I think something that&#039;s lost on these boards and even in documentaries like indie game the movie etc is just how many roles you have to take up as an indie developer. There may have been a time when someone could code a game in their basement and release it on steam the next day and that would do well, but it is definitely not the case now. Pretty much every indie budget game that I&#039;ve seen succeed the past few years has been accompanied by tireless promotional work. I was talking about this with Joar yesterday, how there&#039;s basically this unspoken under-culture of devs as &quot;marketing nomads&quot; going from convention to convention perpetually, in different states and countries,&nbsp; exposing a game to new audiences, making journalists aware of it, building support from various communities, etc etc. It&#039;s like running a political campaign or something! But if you&#039;ve spent years of your life and all of your savings account developing a game, you can&#039;t take the risk of just throwing it out there and hoping for the best.<br><br>Outside of the traveling circus of the industry I don&#039;t think anyone is really aware of it. Like, the average person might go to a convention and see a dev there with their game and assume &quot;oh cool, they are at this convention&quot;, but the truth is that they are at EVERY convention, and they probably have been for months or years, writing code in the hotel room, sending emails on shitty Starbucks wifi. This goes for the most polished indie darling to the roughest unity asset flip. Kind of fascinating, really. Even devs that are considered to be &quot;reclusive&quot; by the online gaming&nbsp; community I see regularly at these events, working hard. Phil Fish was at XOXO, Tarn Adams was at BIC, etc etc<br><br>And as an indie you are doing this with a very small team of course, so long story short sometimes we&#039;re not reading too deeply into the TIGS comments, or will forego responding to questions that are answered elsewhere in the thread&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309163706im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/gentleman.gif" alt="Gentleman" border="0"><br><br><br><br><br>As for the alpha that&#039;s on humble, the link is legit but it is **OLD** and not in any way representative of the current game, so I personally would only recommend it to people who might be interested in following the development process in some depth. It might be interesting for people like Christian and Chris Early who have played the Lingo alpha years ago, then this early C# build and then get to see how the mechanics evolve into the final game, but likely not to the average player.<br><br>And lastly: shoutout to the TIGS fam for holding down the threads while we&#039;ve been away, answering questions, etc. Y&#039;all are the best&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309163706im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/hand-metal-r.gif" alt="Hand Metal Right" border="0"><br><br><br>

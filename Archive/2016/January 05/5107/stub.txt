Yep, I now changed it so that the black pupils are very uncommon, and pupils in general are kind of uncommon but if they occur they&#039;re mostly colored. I always hesitate to right out throw a individualization feature out if I can just make it rare, because the individualization takes some priority over every single individual looking super good in my book. If they are to be distinguishable some of them need to be out on the extremes and might end up goofy looking, and I&#039;m actually more okay with that rather than all of them looking the same. Hell, in real life there are a few goofy looking dogs, horses and humans&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309211549im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0"><br><br>Also I&#039;m not all too opposed of the goofiness itself. As we&#039;ve talked about a few times before (pretty long ago by now I realize) the art style is supposed to have a cartoony element, and some individuals might channel that more than others. Rain World might have some grim moments, but it&#039;s not DOOM (I love DOOM btw, best thing ever, just that I&#039;m going in a different direction) and not every creature is supposed to look like a dark grim meany. Rather, the charm as I see it comes from a bit of a sweet/sour clash of styles where both the cartoony and the relentless is present. Tom&amp;Jerry meets Darwin, so to speak. The grim aspect seems to be what people notice about RW because it&#039;s not as common in other media I suppose, but RW is not only horrible and grim, it can be pretty funny too! Such as when a white lizard misses you with its tongue and ends up dangling from a ceiling, etc. So yeah, a little bit of both.<br><br><b>Update 504</b><br><br>Working on scavenger AI! They now have a super rudimentary idle behavior similar to that of the lizard, which I want to expand a bit on when they are more generally functional. Also I&#039;ve started on an attacking behavior, where they will chase you if they have a spear or other weapon, and otherwise they will go retrieve a spear or other weapon - seems to work nicely!<br><br>One interesting aspect of their AI is that they will have a bit different personalities. I&#039;ve gotten started on that already, by generating a personality type for each individual. The personality consists of three base stats and three derived stats. The base stats are completely independent of each other, and may thus appear in any combination. They are<br><br>Sympathy<br>Energy<br>Bravery<br><br>From these three more stats are derived. Those are<br><br>Nervous (high energy, low bravery)<br>Aggression (high energy and bravery, but low sympathy)<br>Dominance (Depends on energy, bravery and aggression)<br><br>The derived stats are heavily influenced by the base stats, but there is a little window for them to fluctuate and define their own value randomly, so occasionally you might get an off-shoot. <br><br>These stats already feed into the behaviors of the scavengers a little bit, and will have a heavier influence when I get to the more intricate behavior. For example, a nervous scavenger will have a hard time sitting still while idling, and will twitch and look around itself all the time. <br><br>Also it was low hanging fruit to feed these into the cosmetic appearance procedure, so now their looks depend a bit on these different stats. The cosmetics are allowed to fluctuate randomly but will gravitate a bit towards certain values, so while you might get the occasional lazy+skinny individual it will be more common to get lazy and chubby ones. Dominance has an impact on antler size and general body size, mean ones are more prone to the narrow pupil-less slits for eyes etc.<br><br>I didn&#039;t want a super obvious disney thing&nbsp; where you see Scar in the beginning of the Lion King and go &quot;gosh, I wonder who the villain is&quot; so I&#039;ve allowed for quite a bit of random fluctuation - it&#039;s just a subtle influence. Personally I can seldom tell from looking at a scavenger what it&#039;s stats will be, maybe with the exception of the dominance one which has some bigger influences. But maybe it will give you some little subliminal vibes when playing.

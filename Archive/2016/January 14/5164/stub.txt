<b>Update 513</b><br><br>How to approach a pack of scavengers - Don&#039;t:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308164948im_/https://giant.gfycat.com/FatalSplendidCamel.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Do:<br>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308164948im_/https://giant.gfycat.com/ZestySlimGoldeneye.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>They now have some basic ability to interpret player behavior and react to it. If you&#039;re cool they will also play it cool - if you antagonize them they&#039;ll respond in kind. In that first gif they go into a behavior where they&#039;re threatening me (they&#039;re pointing spears at me, but that animation might need a little work to bring the spear out of the body&#039;s silhouette), and by not moving I show that I&#039;ve given up. If I would&#039;ve continued jumping around harassing them they would probably have given me a spear to the gut.<br><br>Their behavior is not always the same - it&#039;s influenced by their personality stats, the group, and the group leader. As the group leader has an influence on all the others, coming across a squad with an unsympathetic or aggressive leader might end up worse than one which has a nice chieftain.<br><br>They each track an individual relationship to you, and there also exists a number which is sort of your general reputation among the scavengers. If you commit violence against them or throw spears in their general direction they will start disliking you - the specific individuals that saw you do it at first, but down the line all scavengers you come across. On the other hand, if you save the life of a scavenger they&#039;ll start liking you more - especially that particular individual. If they&#039;re very fond of you you can hang out as one of the pack. <br><br>Animation still a little wonky, as you can see. I&#039;m working on it. The general behaviors are pretty much done though. One problem I have is that when you spawn them in the world with other creatures, they seldom venture very far as they get scared/into combat with different creatures they encounter and retreat. Don&#039;t quite know what to do about that - maybe just making them a bit less concerned about nearby vultures etc might be a good idea. Also giving them random idle positions that are further out in the room as they enter it might make them a bit more prominent.

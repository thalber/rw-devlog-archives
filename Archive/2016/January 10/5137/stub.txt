Not needed, they all max out by default!<br><br><b>Update 509</b><br><br>New plant species for the Sky Islands refurbish. <br><br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309211621/http://imgwiz.com/images/2016/01/10/Cgxrm.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309211621im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2016/01/10/Cgxrm.png" alt="" width="800" border="0"></a><br><br>These guys took me an entire day, no joke&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309211621im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/tired.gif" alt="Tired" border="0"> So don&#039;t know if there&#039;s going to be much other large plants like this in the game. Not entirely counting it out though, the art is pretty important to the general game experience. <br><br>They come in a few different parts that are assembled in the level editor, making for a pretty big number of variations. Also the highlights and shadows on them rendered by the editor rather than statically drawn into the asset, so they can be rotated and flipped without looking off with regards to the light source.<br><br>Excited to see how James is going to use them!

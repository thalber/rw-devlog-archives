Think them not doing that sets them apart as being holograms!<br><br>Code/logic/think question:<br><br>These two snippets of code should yield identical results, right?<br><br><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code">&nbsp; &nbsp; protected bool TimeInfluencedRandomRoll(float chance, int time)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for (int i = 0; i &lt; time; i++)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if (UnityEngine.Random.value &lt; chance)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return true;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return false;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; }</div><br>and<br><br><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code">&nbsp; &nbsp; protected bool TimeInfluencedRandomRoll(float chance, int time)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return Mathf.Pow(UnityEngine.Random.value, time) &lt; chance;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; }<br></div><br>Say that I flip a coin 3 times, and if ANY of those times I get side A that&#039;s a positive. Then my chance to never get A should be:<br><br>50% ^ 3 = 12.5%<br><br>I can&#039;t wrap my head around it, but that latter code snippet seems to be returning way more positives than it should, and I don&#039;t know why.

The game will definitely recognize it and convey it to the player - we have some narrative points tied to it planned out!<br><br><b>Update 524</b><br><br>There&#039;s a new creature (or something) coming up! Working on the &quot;overseer&quot;.<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308165940im_/https://giant.gfycat.com/InsignificantNeedyGadwall.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>The visuals are still WIP - more details will be added, I don&#039;t know about the color, etc etc. They&#039;re able to produce small holographic projections, and I want some of that going on around their heads to give them a bit more character rather than just being a tube with an eye.<br><br>These guys will be encountered throughout Rain World, where they zip around and... watch. Creepily! They&#039;re observing the creatures, and are extra interested in the more intelligently behaving ones. Your inter-region movement and deliberate actions will quickly attract their interest.

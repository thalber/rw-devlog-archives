Some work together! Creatures can squabble for any number of reasons, over food, territory or just being annoyed with one another. The breeds have certain tendencies, but each individual lizard also has its own unique personality blend that makes it behave slightly differently, plus being informed by whatever experiences it&#039;s had. If it&#039;s been injured or threatened by a creature before, it might act more aggressively or more fearfully depending on its personality, etc etx<br><br>Joars gotten a bit of that in the alphas and betas, but we plan on going quite a bit further with it still, should be a lot of fun once were there!

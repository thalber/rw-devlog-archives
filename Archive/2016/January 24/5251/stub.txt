Hm hm hm... The problem is that what I&#039;m <i>after </i>is that decline that makes it hit zero at x = 1. This actually makes sense if you consider the graphical result I&#039;m after. If you consider the zoom level at the corners as a default, there should be zero distortion out there. At the center of the screen you can&#039;t have any radial distortion or else you end up overshooting the center coordinate and get weird circular artifacts. So, what remains to be distorted is the area in-between, ie 0&lt;x&lt;1.<br><br>Another problem is that what may appear as very small differences on a graph becomes large and noticeable in the actual shader. For example, the simpler function y = x<sup>5</sup> - x<sup>7</sup> looks similar to the more complicated y = 2*(x<sup>4+2x</sup> - x<sup>5+2x</sup>) when plotted, but in the shader it makes the difference that the entire center area suddenly looks flat rather than bulging with the bulge now concentrated to the sides, which isn&#039;t as visually exciting. <br><br>My friend suggested a lookup-table as a solution. That might be worth trying?

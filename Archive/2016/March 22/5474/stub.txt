naturally were going to be doing a lot of testing with all of this, so if it does become an issue adjusting it is the easiest thing in the world. but that said... we want rain to be dangerous; a constant unpredictable looming threat, forcing you to scurry from shelter to shelter. to cross a region is a dangerous adventure requiring planning, preparation, etc. thats the idea anyway! I do like Christians idea for increasingly frequent rain cycles over time though.<br><br>whats nice is that all of the pieces and various game mechanics have been designed in a very modular fashion, so balancing and tuning should generally be pretty simple and quick. *knocks on all wooden surfaces in immediate vicinity*

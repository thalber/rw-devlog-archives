Don&#039;t think I&#039;d generate the texture in CG though, in my setup I just have shader CG code that runs for each frame times each pixel. So better then to generate it on game start up and then just feed the texture to the shader.<br><br>It would solve the problem for sure. I actually wouldn&#039;t even need a 2D texture - the direction of the displacement is always the same (towards center) so what I need is just the magnitude of it which could be stored in a 1D texture, where the r value of each pixel is magnitude in one direction and the g value is magnitude in the other. Easy!<br><br>The reason I&#039;m hesitating is that it feels slightly... inelegant. Don&#039;t want to generate and keep a texture in the ram which I have to keep a reference to etc... When it should be possible to do it all in pure math. Also I&#039;m starting to have a little bit of an issue with the time the game takes to boot (think it&#039;s just the sheer amount of code compiling - it&#039;s a second or two so not a problem as a loading time for a finished game but a bit annoying in development where you have to jump in and out again and again) so I&#039;m not in love with the idea of adding another potentially time consuming procedure on start up. <br><br>Hm hm hm. Gonna try the maths approach a little bit more, then I&#039;ll probably give up and do the texture either way!

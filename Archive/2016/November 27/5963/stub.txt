thanks friend! seriously, its been quite a month. hope you all are holding up as well.<br><br>totally boring update: right now were finishing up the PS4 port and sheesh its tedious. the code is super old and undocumented, so the port team (who apparently have infinite patience) will change one thing to optimize this or that, and it&#039;ll accidentally break or change something else. so im basically just running new builds of the game constantly and checking every room and event over and over to make sure nothing new has broken. but other than taking a long time its going pretty well. they have been able to get some really impressive frame rates in spots that previously would grind, and we&#039;ve been able to apply a good deal of their technical knowledge to the PC version as well, so its basically made everything better.<br><br>Joar just moved back to Sweden from Seoul, so I&#039;d expect him to be checking in here more regularly. Del is rushing rushing rushing to get through a seemingly unending list of illustration work from us. we&#039;ve gotten so much feedback thats basically &quot;the illustrations are amazing, there should be more of them&quot;, so were trying to get as much in as possibly before this last deadline. With the holidays and post election depression its been a struggle though.<br><br>anyway, the grind continues! we&#039;ll be showing rain world at the playstation experience (PSX) in a week, and should have a shiny new RW trailer for that, as well as some other fun stuff. cheers friends, hope you are all well!&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308171131im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/toast-r.gif" alt="Toast Right" border="0">

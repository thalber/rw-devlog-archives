Thank you! Yeah hilariously the shelter saving crashes that ps4 build, so I had to figure out how to show the game without its primary progression mechanic for 3 days <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308170515im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/facepalm.gif" alt="Facepalm" border="0"> But hopefully to the outside observer it looked natural enough.<br><br>Also tbh there are some aspects to the shelter and saving mechanic that we are *kinda* keeping secret (you&#039;ll see!), so I&#039;m not unhappy to be able to wait until it&#039;s all finished and looking nice before showing!

Not sure how feasible it would be, but could you make that a tutorial? A &quot;monkey see, monkey do&quot; kind of thing? Traveling with an older/slugcat partner going through a linear area, the other slugcat performing moves and such, thus demonstrating to the player what to do?<br></div><br>Ideally, yes! This was my first suggestion waaaay back when we were starting the tutorial stuff, but apparently Rain World&#039;s character movement and AI are done in a manner thats completely opposite to &quot;sockpuppeting&quot;: the movement AI is completely tied to pathfinding and a million other systems, so we can&#039;t just plop in another slugcat and ask it to act without rebuilding a bunch of super low level systems. Very annoying, but also not atypical for &quot;Rain World problems.&quot; With our tools and engine it&#039;s easy to do weird Rain Worldy stuff, and hard to do normal basic gamey stuff.<br><br>So! As you may have surmised from earlier posts, we&#039;re using a friendly Overseer, who we call &quot;Iggy&quot;, to fill in that role and show the player the ropes, and that aspect is working out really well.<br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308170632/https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?PHPSESSID=kq4pjndhui7mtuu6qje4din5p4&amp;topic=25183.msg1262911#msg1262911">Quote from: Teod on July 08, 2016, 11:25:20 PM</a></div><div class="quote">In my experience as a player the best alternative to text is animation of the button(s) being pressed. If you combine it with animated holograms you seem to already have, you&#039;ll end up with demonstration of input needed to perform an action, which is an equvalent of &quot;press X to jump&quot; thing. It will also be more useful than text for combinations of keys and for actions where timing is important, such as backflips: it&#039;s harder to understand &quot;move in one direction, then change the direction of your movement and jump&quot; in text than in visual form. Basically show <i>how</i> the hologram does what it does, not just what.<br><br></div><br>Yep, totally! Iggy projects context-appropriate gamepad and button-presses if the player isnt able to quickly progress through certain level puzzles, plus offers hints, etc. I think my &quot;press X to jump&quot; example was misleading, as that basic stuff is going relatively well, its more teaching the player to understand the relationships between the various game mechanics: hunting food, eating food, finding shelter, the map system, the rain cycle countdown, and of course... the weird and confusing &quot;karma system&quot; which will probably never make sense to anyone but us.<br><br>Right now we have it so that Iggy takes the player through a cycle, shows them the controls, some slugcat moves, shows them some foods sources, shows them to a shelter, and players are totally fine completing that no problem. But without being told explicitly &quot;you need X food to survive&quot; and &quot;the rain is coming, which will kill you, so you need to find a shelter&quot; they don&#039;t really see how those puzzle pieces connect. <br><br>So! I think we&#039;ll try adding just that and try how that goes, fingers crossed. Thanks for the suggestions and links!

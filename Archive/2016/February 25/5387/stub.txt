Very hesitant to go into detail on that as it&#039;s deep spoiler territory, but I can say as much that we have a thing planned out that isn&#039;t just a linear story with start, middle, end. From our experience on the convention floor people adopt very different play styles, and we want to encourage that within the actual framework of the game.

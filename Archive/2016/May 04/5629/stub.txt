The scavenger lantern:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308170158im_/https://media.giphy.com/media/3oEjI5HUdXGHdpPTNK/giphy.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>(The graphic of the actual lantern might change a bit, I&#039;m reusing another sprite atm which I&#039;m not 100% happy with)<br><br>The scav lanterns are very valuable in Shadow Urban, as they are strong, reliant light sources that can be carried in one hand and don&#039;t struggle/flee like the Lantern Mice.<br><br>Scavenger fire spear:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308170158im_/https://media.giphy.com/media/l41YwCqiEO4lVfjSE/giphy.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>The fire spear is a spear with a fabric around the top, apparently containing some powder of some sort. These are terrifying when being used against you, but can also be a valuable resource as they&#039;re a very powerful offence. The sneaky game design trick here is that while they appear super terrifying when used against you, they don&#039;t actually make the game much harder, as you die from just a normal spear already. Contrary, scavengers attacking you with these might provide a small benefit as that gives you the chance to get your hands on one.<br><br>As you might notice, these items are basically purely better versions of already existing items. The idea with that is not to ruin the balance of the game, but to provide a reason for interacting with scavengers. Scavs are the only source of these goodies, and in order to get your hands on them you&#039;ll need to either trade with, be friends with or fight the scavengers, each with their corresponding consequences. <br><br>

one thing thats been interesting(?) to realize over the course of showing rain world at various conventions, interviews and events, etc., is just how much information needs to be conveyed in order to give a person an idea of &quot;what the game is about&quot;. I usually try to gauge a person&#039;s interest first and give a series of shorter answers that work by themselves, but also can be stacked up and elaborated on if the person seems like they are willing to go deep into it. <br><br>this article isnt entirely accurate with some of the details (i was either misquoted a few times or *really* tired for whatever interview it was taken from), but is also kind of spot on in how it presents the game. details or not, the author totally gets it, and thats pretty encouraging: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308170158/http://www.gamesradar.com/rain-world-wants-you-to-feel-bad-for-killing-its-hungry-enemies/" target="_blank">http://www.gamesradar.com/rain-world-wants-you-to-feel-bad-for-killing-its-hungry-enemies/</a>

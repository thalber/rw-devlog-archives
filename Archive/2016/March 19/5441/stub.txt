The way its working is that each cycle survived increases your &quot;karma level&quot; (currently capped at 5), and each time you die reduces it. Each gate has a certain karma level that required to pass through from 1-5, and certain directions require more than others. The idea being that if you are an experienced player that is able to quickly hunt and stay alive through a bunch of consecutive cycles, all the gates will be passable to you and you can adopt a more aggressive pace. But if you die, it forces you to slow down, regroup and be cautious, hopefully improving your skills. <br><br>Ive been playing a LOT more since this went in, and i cant even tell you how much more fun it is, even for me who is far too intimately knowledgeable about the region layouts. All these little creature neighborhoods open up to you that previously you&#039;d just see once passing through. In my current save, im in Heavy Industry right next to a water tank filled with snails that has 2 blue lizard living nearby. Initially the lizards would just snoop around and I&#039;d quickly swim through to escape, but over a few cycles they seem to have learned my tricks and position themselves better, so now its a mad dash to dive and grab snails to detonate and knock them out. <br><br>But in my year+ of making and playing this region, none of that had ever happened before! You&#039;d rush through once and that would be that. Spending more time with the fauna allows for all these emergent experiences as the procedurally generated personalities of the individual creatures interplay and your interactions with them shape their behaviour in subsequent cycles.&nbsp; Im kind of blown away right now to be honest.&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308165822im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/hand-anykey.gif" alt="Hand Any Key" border="0">

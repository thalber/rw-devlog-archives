i feel like im doing that right now to be honest! ive pretty much slept the past two days since getting back&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308165754im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/yawn.gif" alt="Yawn" border="0"><br><br><br>So as you might expect, quite a few new mechanics have been added recently as we are polishing up the gameplay experience, but Joar just put in something we call the Karma Gate system and its a total revelation imo. Some aspects are still being worked out, and im sure he&#039;ll want to talk about it further when hes free, but basically its a system that requires the player to survive a certain amount of cycles in a row in order to progress through region gates. <br><br>This was implemented initially to prevent the tendency of players to throw themselves through the terrain as fast as possible trying to find the next region/shelter/etc, or to just quit when a rain cycle comes in. It slows the pace a bit and rewards a more cautious approach, which is cool. But more importantly imo is that it really brings out the &quot;scarcity&quot; aspect built into the bats/food sources. As you devour bat nests and fruit, they deplete, forcing you to search further and further in the region, and with the map tool you now strategize routes that will allow you to find food and also reach the region gate before the rain hits. <br><br>Plus it forces you to become really personal with the local creatures as you are stuck with them for a period of time, and that highlights the procedural creature generation so you get to really experience their individual personalities and how their opinion of you develops. From my perspective this Karma Gate mechanic totally tied all the aspects of the game together, so im *super enthused*.&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308165754im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/hand-shake-l.gif" alt="Hand Shake Left" border="0"> <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308165754im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/hand-shake-r.gif" alt="Hand Shake Right" border="0">

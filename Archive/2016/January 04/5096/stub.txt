Finally a question I can answer haha!&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309211557im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/cheesy.gif" alt="Cheesy" border="0"><br><br>The number of sprites in the head varies depending on the specific antler setup. A typical scavenger head is built like this:<br><br>the head base, a simple oval<br>teeth, a polygon mesh<br>antlers, multiple polygon meshes<br>base eyes, simple ovals<br>some of them have pupils or &quot;deep set eyes&quot; where the eyes are drawn with two ovals in a way that makes it look that they have a &quot;rim&quot; and a &quot;bottom surface&quot;. In those cases these details go on top as another set of ovals.<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309211557im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/12/29/XVwve.gif" alt="" width="882" height="699" border="0"><br>(Example of the &quot;deep set eyes&quot;. If you look closely you can see that they consist of two colors - one almost white and the other yellow. This is handled like a pupil, but one which is fixed to always look in the opposite direction of the head&#039;s direction - giving the impression of a slight incline rather than a bulge.)<br><br>The antlers are drawn as lines. The vertices of the lines are sent through a rotation script, that contrary to the Rain Deer antlers doesn&#039;t apply any actual 3D rotation, but rather just rotates them around the Z axis and/or squashes them in the X or Y dimension, when the head is seen in profile.<br><br>As the head is changing direction the eyes are moved accordingly - and when the head is nearing a side view one of the eyes is squashed along an axis perpendicular to its rotation. In the full side view, that squash is complete and the sprite has a width of 0px, making it invisible as if it was on the opposite side of the head. <br><br>The neck is also drawn as a line along a number of points, similarly to the antler sections. It has a gradient between the body color and the head color, unifying the two.

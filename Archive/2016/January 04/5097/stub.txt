In other news, James just sent me the refurbished version of Garbage Wastes region, and it looks <i>amazing</i>. The palette work is magnificent, and now the garbage piles has huge machine parts resting across them at odd angles - it really invokes an awesome sense of mystery about what the hell those machines are and where they come from. And you get to find out! As the waste collection area of the RW industrial complex, many parts and pieces from other regions have ended up here and are rusting on the heaps, so running through this region you will get little tastes of environments to come. This is of course also an economical design decision, as it allows us to use assets already created for other regions, but we also think it&#039;s a pretty awesome part of the player&#039;s experience. <br><br>The visual lift this region has gone through is outstanding. I&#039;d even say that it&#039;s on the level of, or perhaps surpassing, that of the Suburban polish pass, and that is saying something! James&#039; skill and to some degree tool box has expanded greatly since his last touch on this region, and that really shows. Super excited!

Thanks! Yeah no-one seem terribly enthusiastic about the pupils, so maybe they&#039;ll go out, or change shape somehow. <br><br><b>Update 503</b><br><br>The scavengers are going to have access to a system of tunnels that only they can use and which will allow them to travel across the region. The idea is that they will feel omnipresent, able to show up and disappear at a whim. Like ninjas! This means some technical work on my part though, as a new node type and the corresponding behaviors need to be installed. Been working my way through that today, and it seems to be working! Having some difficulty setting up a proper test environment though, so might need to wait until James has installed those &quot;scavenger nodes&quot; in a region for the final verdict. Looking pretty hopeful though!<br><br>Working with the scavenger nodes I finally found out what was causing an old bug where creatures would mysteriously disappear in abstract rooms. Really good to have found that problem, but the roots of it seem to go somewhat deep, so wasn&#039;t able to sort it out immediately. At least now I know where it&#039;s lurking!

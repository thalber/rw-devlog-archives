We&#039;ve made the slugcat&#039;s breath meter less confusing a while back. It used to be based on two float values - one that was the amount of air in your lungs, and one that was a &quot;lung exhaustion meter&quot; that would go up if you where at a very low amount of air. The exhaustion would make your lungs deplete faster, and not regenerate until you had filled the lungs 100% again. All of this invisible... Of course it was impossible to play with. <br><br>The new system has the lung exhaustion meter still there (it&#039;s needed so that you can&#039;t play an air creature, eg vulture, infinitely by just popping in and out of the water) but has made its state binary, and a little more forgiving. Also some other changes were made... It&#039;s a while ago. I think that previously the water would instantly kill you, but now there&#039;s a state of unconsciousness first where you have a chance of floating up to the surface and making it. Anyhows, it has cleared things up a little bit. That dive there is still in and VERY difficult, but possible. Otherwise the underwater death traps seem to be all taken care of.

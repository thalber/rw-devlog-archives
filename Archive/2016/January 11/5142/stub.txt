Also it looks a bit better. When the body gets a throw command from the AI, it enters the wind up animation.

The yellow meter on the utility comparer is curiosity for unresolved sounds - as you can see it&#039;s capped pretty low, meaning that urges to fight or flee etc will basically always take precedence, but if the scavenger has nothing do it might decide to go check a strange noise out. <br><br>With most of the base behaviors done, I have also started looking on their behavior in abstract space, ie how they move on the world map. I think I will go for something similar as the miros bird, which hang out in an abstract room that can never be entered by the player until there&#039;s a little gang of them, and then together go out on a raid. The scavengers will probably appear in loser packs though, and occasionally alone.

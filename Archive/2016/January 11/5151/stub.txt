@chris, #scavengers looking at spears: Yeah, sounds reasonable. Currently the picking up of spears is a sub behavior of the attack behavior, meaning that the focal point is still considered the attack target - but something could probably be done to make them momentarily turn their head towards the item in question just before picking it up.<br><br>#spears appearing out of no-where: Actually that one spear which seems to magically appear was on the ground but unluckily ended up perfectly vertical hidden by that pole. The scavenger picks it up and it looks as if appearing in its hand. Sort of an unlucky coincidence in this particular recording, I&#039;d say that the chance of a spear being perfectly vertical and behind a pole is &lt;1%. When the scavengers actually carry spears, you can see them attached to their bodies or their hands.<br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308164909/https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?PHPSESSID=ch7adbijlb58b4cl3ojhpdfpj3&amp;topic=25183.msg1211697#msg1211697">Quote from: mtarini on January 11, 2016, 08:10:54 PM</a></div><div class="quote">Not that you need my Kudos, but the potential of this project, and the quality of this devlog, leaves me almost literally breathless. The visuals. Just, look at the visuals. You crated a few of the best looking procedural animations I&#039;ve EVER seen and the overall results is that these creatures are just beyond words. They look so alive and genuine, you swear they are real animals, well, not real animals, real... something. Real something with definitely a soul, and burning intentions, and the unmistakable spark of conscious life. You reached past the point where one looks and wonders *how* you did that, over the zone where one just looks in demented amazement. You obviously did it by magic. Either that or a stupendous sequence of like one absurdly lucky inspiration / tremendously appropriate choice after the other, for like 500+ consecutive, blessed steps. I&#039;ll go for magic.<br></div><br>Thank you! That really means a lot. Knowing that people are this excited keeps me going. There is no magic involved, just a pragmatic art-oriented approach combined with years of hard work... If you go back to the first pages of this devlog you can see the evolution of the project yourself!<br>

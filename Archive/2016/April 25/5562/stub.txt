If you approach, they&#039;ll make clear that it&#039;s not OK for you to pass through the outpost. Trying to force your way through will be met with violence, and a general bad reputation impact with scavengers. If you offer some nice gifts though, they might let you through. <br><br>To make this work I had to do quite a lot of AI work with the scavengers. New is a &quot;player is offering a gift&quot; part of the social event engine, which currently is for scavengers only but which I hope to extend to lizards etc. <br><br>For scavengers specifically they&#039;ve been outfitted with a communication AI module, which allows them to walk up to the player and do some gesture animation if they feel the need to reach out to you.

great pics! exactly the sort of inspiration in my mood board! the question about human architectural signifiers is a good one, something that joar and i have talked about at length numerous times over the course of development, and our ideas on it have evolved quite a bit over the years. (i even did a talk about it for the harvard graduate school of design last year!) <br><br>as you correctly assume from the name, Suburban and some of the earlier regions were initially intended to be more overtly understandable as the remains of some previous civilizations dwellings (what is currently &quot;Heavy Industrial&quot; was originally &quot;Dense Urban&quot;, which was going to explore a Kowloon Walled City type environment), but for a number of reasons we opted for a more vague approach. <br><br>first and foremost is that we wanted to create a world as seen through the eyes of something slightly below human intelligence. the slugcat is smart enough to recognize that there is probably some purpose to the structures around it, but not comprehend their meaning. same with the use of &quot;language&quot;, letters and characters, etc. the idea is to create a kind of dreamlike atmosphere where the player projects meaning into the structures they see, creating their own expectations about what they might be for and where they might lead, and we play with resolving those expectations quite a bit in the region / world map layout.<br><br>similarly, we wanted any specifics about the previous cultures of rain world to remain vague. the player might assume &quot;human&quot; by default, but thats not necessarily the case and we dont want to feed into that reading too much. whats important is that they were there, they built these structures, and now theyre gone. <br><br>also important is that the slugcat operates among the in-between spaces of these industrial ruins, like a rat in the subway or a squirrel on a rooftop. you&#039;ll sometimes see those overtly designed I.M. Pei vistas, where the structures seem to line up in some grand plan, but most of the time its a ditch filled with garbage and a pipe sticking out, or the crumbling basement of a building. so even if it werent some fantasy alien world we were working in, i think we&#039;d still keep the overtly human signifiers to a minimum.

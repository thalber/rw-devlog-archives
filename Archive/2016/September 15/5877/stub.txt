In our minds Rainworld has been pretty overhyped and media saturated, so we have been consciously making an effort to downplay things the past months until we do the official release date / trailer and all of that (hence the lack of new footage, etc etc.) We dont want the game to come out and people to be like &quot;ah yes, its rainworld, which looks like it has for the past 5 years&quot;.&nbsp; <br><br>But that said we are still obligated to show the game and be present for conventions and events, which carries its own natural hype. Similarly, if a journalist gets in touch and wants to do a thing of course we&#039;re not going to tell them &quot;no&quot;, that would be idiotic. But we also havent been actively seeking it out, if that makes sense. Though soon enough we will be! And we have 8 months of flashy progress to show, so im pretty excited for that.<br><br><br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308170856/https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?PHPSESSID=n1gvl24h4bpok3tjkab5qc80q4&amp;topic=25183.msg1281170#msg1281170">Quote from: kennoley on September 12, 2016, 01:59:07 PM</a></div><div class="quote"><b> *If I buy the alpha I will get the final version of the game when it comes out?* </b><br></div><br>yes! though probably only on Steam.

Knowing how variable, tedious and time-consuming all this stuff is (as well as awareness of the various bureaucracies involved), we *very consciously* never announced any official release date and we only will when everything is locked in and we are 100% confident with being able to hit that date. But hopefully soon!!!!<br><br><br><br>ok thats as far back as the quote machine goes, so let me know if i missed anything! im going to try to get joar to post too, i know you all miss him. <br><br>and hey i really appreciate you guys and gals all sticking up for us on the threads, and just in general. i honestly think of you all as friends and hope we can share a drink or whatever some day. i wont lie: development is lonely and super alienating. for years we&#039;ve spent locked away in basements working insane hours, separated from the real world, living this weird life of half utter isolation / half 100,000 person conventions and media appearances. its impossible to discuss IRL, friends cant relate, its too weird. for me, twitter and TIGS have been my outlets. not just common interests, but people who are going through the same stuff. so anyway, cheers to you all&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308170856im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/toast-r.gif" alt="Toast Right" border="0">

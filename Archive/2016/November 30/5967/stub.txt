thanks jprosk! means a lot.<br><br>no news on a pre-order yet! sony has a pretty tight pre-order policy that requires us to have passed through their extensive certification first, which were in the process of doing now (though it takes a little while, especially since we&#039;re doing it in multiple languages). <br><br>actually is the same with their policy for release dates too, which is why we havent been able to say anything for so long. but supposedly once we clear through those teeedious hurdles everything should lock in place pretty quickly.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>i hope&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308171131im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/screamy.gif" alt="Screamy" border="0"><br><br><br>

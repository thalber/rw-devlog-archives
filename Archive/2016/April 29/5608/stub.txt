<b>Update 530</b><br><br>Food sources pt. 2, Water Nuts. These guys are originally hard little seeds, that can in fact be used as rocks for throwing at enemies, and are completely inedible. If you dip them in water though, they become a delicious frog egg kind of watery blob.<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308170132im_/https://giant.gfycat.com/AbleDangerousChamois.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>How much of a pain getting them to water will be, is completely up to James over in level design department. Sometimes they might grow very close to water, making it easy to just plop them in and enjoy. Other times, it might be a long haul where you have to ask yourself whether it&#039;s worth it to bring them with you, as they do occupy your paws that could otherwise be used for carrying spears or catching bats.

Hey! hi! hello! Yeah, valid. Unfortunately... both things are true simultaneously. Content is wrapped up and we are doing final group testing with new players on controls and tutorial elements. The only thing left other than that is some polishing up of art / UI elements and assorted bug-fixes.<br><br>As for the change in date, the past few months we&#039;ve been sprinting like crazy to hit a certain release window (that was *really* soon), but some 3rd party stuff came up last minute that couldnt be avoided and now we have to wait until the next window. Its not AS bad as you probably think, but we cant announce it until some other things get locked into place.<br><br>For some context, at this point there are a bunch of other moving pieces beyond just when the game is finished. Publishers and porting teams and platforms all have packed release schedules the next few months, and for a successful launch everything has to line up just right for all of them. With all the time, money and blood (so much bloooood) thats been poured into this project, we have to nail these last steps.<br><br>No question that we&#039;re disappointed though, because we absolutely killed ourselves to get things wrapped up in time (seriously, its been brutal), only to get derailed by elements that were out of our control. But honestly... this is best for the game too. In order to make the sooner timeline work out we were compromising on the quality of certain things in ways that neither of us were comfortable with. Now with this added time we can polish the polish and add that last 5%... and get that big content update ready to go for post-launch&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308170447im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/hand-anykey.gif" alt="Hand Any Key" border="0"><br><br>So anyway, on to the twitter death threats!

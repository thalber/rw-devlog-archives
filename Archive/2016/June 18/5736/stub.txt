Hellooo! Okay, back from E3. Whew that was intense&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308170515im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/shocked.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0"><br><br>Yes, quite a few nice long gameplay vids up! That Sony underground one Christian linked was good, and we had a 30 min long twitch interview that wound up going pretty deep too. Others vids we&#039;re pretty short or catch me at various stages of exhaustion, so probably not interesting for all you Rain World experts here.<br><br>So! To answer some of the above questions, for this E3 we were in the SONY booth and wound up at the last minute having to port a build to playstation 4 in an *extremely small* amount of time. Like, completely impossible actually. But somehow, shockingly, it all worked out! I can&#039;t get into specifics about it as its NDA and contract related stuff right now, but the first time I was able to even play the show build was *literally on the show floor* at the SONY booth the first morning of E3. Basically we were like &quot;I... hope this works&quot;, lol. Not. an. ideal. situation. believeeeeeeeee me.<br><br>For that reason it was a pretty old (but stable!) build getting ported that just happened to be laying around exactly when we needed it, so there were tons of minor things with it. For instance that build was what we were using to test the observer&#039;s behavior, so as you noticed they were a little annoying. There were actually quite a few crashing bugs in this build too, so the challenge was to do these interviews showing large chunks of the gameplay while avoiding certain creature or world interactions that would bring up error screens while being livestreamed on the front page of twitch or whatever. SUPER HARD MODE! lmao. But doing events like this (and i have done many), you find that you just have to roll with whatever comes and make the best.<br><br>Anyway! Back to the grind...<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308170515im_/https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ClGhZYpVAAATD0g.jpg" alt="" border="0">

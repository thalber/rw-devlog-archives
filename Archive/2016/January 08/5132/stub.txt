@Joh, thank you! The game is actually firmly 2D, the depth aspect is just about the level textures having a bit of depth encoded that the shaders use to make things look less flat, but it&#039;s all just textures. The creatures are flat and composed of stretching, rotating sprites and flat triangle meshes - the sense of shifting angles is just some little mathematical tricks that are fairly simple, ie move eyes towards the left of the head if a &quot;flip&quot; value decreases, etc.<br><br>Safari mode has been considered! I&#039;m into the idea, but don&#039;t quite know where to put it in the game. Maybe as a part of the &quot;sandbox&quot; mode. Also you can make the game track an AI creature in a region as it goes about its business, which is pretty fun!<br><br>@Christian, yeah, it&#039;s sort of a biggie! The scavengers can carry 4 items, so they will always be better armed than you even if you got the ability to carry two spears, which is kind of the idea. They were made to out-slugcat the slugcat, so to speak. Their advantage is still only in terms of physical abilities though - the AI will never get anywhere close to a human player. Also they don&#039;t see through walls, which is your special superpower as a master of the elusive third dimension. <br><br>When the scavengers have decided to kill something and they have access to spears they can be pretty horrifying, but it&#039;s not 100% certain they&#039;re the most dangerous creature of the game. The ranged attack is kind of unique and very dangerous, but daddy long legs can still be VERY difficult with their grabby tentacles, and vultures can fly which these guys can&#039;t. So a scavenger hellbent on killing you (which you likely won&#039;t see much of in the game) <i>might </i>end up being the most dangerous critter of the fauna, but definitely not by a margin. Mostly they&#039;re unnerving because they&#039;re similar to you, which was exactly the idea <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309211621im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0"><br><br>No other creatures than the slugcat will be playable. The locomotion is intimately connected to the AI, so it&#039;s not easy to just turn the AI off and hook it up to an input.

Yep, they&#039;re looking for something and I think I have an idea! Don&#039;t want to promise anything though, and as that would be cosmetic polish the functional behaviors are prioritized for now.<br><br><b>Update 507</b><br><br>Old meets new! Scavengers have learnt to throw spears (and rocks, but they will use spears if they have them).<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309211621im_/https://giant.gfycat.com/FoolhardyHollowCusimanse.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Scavengers don&#039;t actively try to kill vultures, but vultures try to eat them and their fleeing behavior includes throwing whatever weapons they have at what&#039;s chasing them. This should be tiered a bit - they shouldn&#039;t use lethal force when not in lethal danger, and from you they might &quot;flee&quot; but that will be more about them being uncomfortable with you than deadly afraid, and they shouldn&#039;t hurl spears as they go (unless you really corner them, perhaps). The vultures however they know all to well, and they&#039;ll do whatever it takes to stay alive.<br><br>I&#039;d also like to make it so that defensive violence can turn into aggressive violence if they feel that it&#039;s going well and become enthusiastic about it - depending on their aggression parameter of course. First though, the base behaviors need to be in place.<br><br>A pack of scavengers can output a really impressive cloud of spears, their damage per second puts you thoroughly to shame. As each scavenger can carry many spears and there are many of them, you sometimes see a poor vulture getting blasted by a full broadside bombardment from some vertical structure they&#039;re sitting on, actually killing the thing. Me myself has managed to kill a vulture maybe a couple of times, and never without cheating in one way or another. <br><br>Another thing you can see in the gif if you look very closely, is a spear shifting hands. The green-eyed brown scavenger which is caught by the vulture in the beginning of the gif has many spears. When it rendezvous with the grey, black headed scavenger with long horns and a porcupine back, you might notice how it gains a spear, which is later thrown at the purple vulture - the last spear thrown in the gif.<br><br>I generally imagine the scavengers as sticking to a finders-keepers ethic; the whole joy of scavenging depends on that if you find something, its <i>yours</i>. However, if one scavenger has more than one spear and its pack member has zero, the game might do a roll between the spear owner&#039;s sympathy stat and the perceived desperation of the situation, and the spears might be distributed. In a very dire situation it generally serves the greater good if everyone is armed, as they sometimes manage to save each other. <br><br>As I get into their aggressive behavior I also want to make brave individuals sometimes actively go in for a rescue operation.<br><br>Speaking of aggression, I do have a little bit of that behavior set up already, and have tried to aggro one of them on myself in a death match sort of situation. Man... These guys don&#039;t play around. <br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309211621im_/https://fat.gfycat.com/DifficultEmptyBaiji.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>It&#039;s not easy to survive a scavenger hellbent on killing you. They collect spears, and they hit you with the spears, no mercy.<br><br>It&#039;s important to say though, that in the game the scavengers won&#039;t act as &quot;enemies&quot; with nothing in mind but your destruction - rather they will probably never throw a spear in your direction if you&#039;re a little smart about it. They&#039;ll generally just try to get out of your way, and if you get really annoying they might hit you with a rock to show you what&#039;s what. If you however dedicate yourself to making enemies with them, you might be able to slowly crank up the hostility to something like this. Congratulations, you have effectually broken your save file by making the game mind-numbingly difficult! The idea is that this should by no means happen by accident though - that would be if you spend several cycles murdering scavengers, in which case you kind of had it coming for you&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309211621im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/evil.gif" alt="Evil" border="0">

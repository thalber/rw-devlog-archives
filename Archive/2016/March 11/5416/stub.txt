physically present at GDC! look at us here doing Professional Videogame Developmentâ„¢:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308165724im_/https://i.imgur.com/zT8y5hN.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>&quot;Hmmm yes, these smudged papers are fascinating.&quot;<br><br>A surprising amount of work can be done when people are actually in the same room, as opposed to literally the opposite sides of the planet! So far Joar has implemented a &quot;wiggle system&quot; to allow some possibility of escape from non-binary player death scenarios (when caught by sticky white lizard tongues, worm grass, etc etc); a &quot;room attractiveness&quot; tool that allows us to specify which rooms a creature might want to be in or avoid, allowing for us to fix problem areas, shape the player experience / difficulty curve a bit more, and setup &quot;soft&quot; creature set-pieces; we&#039;ve finally put in region gate shelters, making the entire world map Totally Actually Playable, worked on placing the music, fixed SFX issues, solidified progression details, plus a million little improvements and bug-fixes of course. Stuff is really looking good&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308165724im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/hand-metal-r.gif" alt="Hand Metal Right" border="0"><br><br>Also we&#039;re prepping for Joars talk on Rain World&#039;s procedural animation for the GDC animation bootcamp. Nothing you loyal devlog peeps havent seen, but should be interesting to show it to an audience who may not be familiar with the game. The rest of the talks heavily skew AAA, so we will be the weirdos for sure. Nothing new there! So if you happen to be there, def come say HI and bail us out, haha.

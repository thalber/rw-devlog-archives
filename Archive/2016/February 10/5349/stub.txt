If any of you guys will be going to GDC, Joar and I will be there giving a talk on Rain World procedural animation. Or, he will and ill be up there for moral support! Anyway, if any of you are going to GDC and want to check it, heres some details: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308165527/http://schedule.gdconf.com/session/animation-bootcamp-rainworld-animation-process" target="_blank">http://schedule.gdconf.com/session/animation-bootcamp-rainworld-animation-process</a><br><br>Joar has plans to make an example creature LIVE during the presentation, so that should be pretty fun. And please say hi i you do, we love hanging with tigs peeps! :D<br><br>And thanks thanks for the music suggestions everybody, they were all good! I either played or watched playthroughs of pretty much everything. <br><br>right now im in ear-bleed nightmare zone auditioning, filtering and EQing 1000s of ambient audio clips, but all that is going really well. yesterday we tested a dynamic audio system which ill explain a bit more in later posts, but its something we&#039;ve wanted to include for a while were pretty excited with how its all coming together. tonight ill be doing the first region with complete ambiance audio, dynamic audio and maybe some music triggers as well, so definitely on track to get audio done by the end of the month... which is pretty insane, but hey nothing new there!<br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308165527/https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?PHPSESSID=gsma5um98jvtl937967ogqpgl3&amp;topic=25183.msg1221512#msg1221512">Quote from: Prinsessa on February 10, 2016, 10:27:20 AM</a></div><div class="quote">So I think I&#039;m going to start playing around with some Fish AI&#8482; sometime soon...

Tool user? Able to use the interaction between species to its advantage, like the slugcat? <br></div>We want to keep it somewhat ambiguous, same as with the slugcat itself. The idea is that it&#039;s sort of your peer in this world - where most things are either dumb animals or like, a brain tree, this one is on your level. It&#039;s extensively tool using and nimble with spears... it might even have something to do with the handy pieces of rebar cut in a convenient length and sharpened to one end that are scattered everywhere... but it&#039;s getting spoilery in here so I better keep quiet&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309211557im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0"><br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309211557/https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?PHPSESSID=q16tqkh56181om7aka3o53qlu7&amp;topic=25183.msg1209421#msg1209421">Quote from: presidenthobbes on January 02, 2016, 07:19:36 PM</a></div><div class="quote">Are lizards naturally competetive or&nbsp; is that just a specific trait of those two lizards? Also, are the pink and purple lizards seperate species or are they still just variated colors in the &quot;pink&quot; lizard species?<br></div><br>It varies. Some species actually hunt each other for food, and they don&#039;t get into territorial disputes but engage in chase and flee behaviors. For the others all of them have the squabble behavior, but are differently prone to it, and most noticeable differently prone to getting into fights with different other species. Most are the most antagonistic towards lizards of the same color, presumably as those are viewed as the most immediate rivals. Pinks and greens are kind of notorious, whereas the whites are more chill and passive. <br><br>Pink and purple are just variations on the pink subspecies. That particular one might have a bit too broad color range, it&#039;s come up a few times that people interpret them as different - easy to fix though! <br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309211557/https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?PHPSESSID=q16tqkh56181om7aka3o53qlu7&amp;topic=25183.msg1209462#msg1209462">Quote from: Christian on January 03, 2016, 12:27:32 AM</a></div><div class="quote">IGN.

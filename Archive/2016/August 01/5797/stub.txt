Yeah and it&#039;s not like an &quot;either or&quot; sort of thing, this was just a blind spot we had that&#039;s been corrected somewhat, so one doesn&#039;t take away from the other. Don&#039;t worry, it&#039;s still the same overly complicated, obtuse and confusing old Rain World, we&#039;ve just workshopped the tutorial aspects so that it might now be actually be playable by people that aren&#039;t Joar and myself, lol!<br><br>Basically, long story short: issues that we thought were inherent to the game design turned out to just be a lack of communication to the player. Fixed!&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308170658im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/hand-joystick.gif" alt="Hand Joystick" border="0">

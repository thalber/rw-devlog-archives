Hi guys! Sorry about not devlogging and then busting in here asking your help haha, but I&#039;m doing SUPER SPOILER stuff - once this is done devlogging will be back on, promise!<br><br>So, as I said I&#039;m deep in spoiler territory, so I&#039;ll have to ask this question in the most abstract manner I can. Very technical question, as usual&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308165909im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/whome.gif" alt="Who, Me?" border="0"><br><br>Imagine that you have an awful lot of objects in a 3D scene, say trees on a field, say 900 of them. You want to place them at random so it looks nice. <br><br>What I tried was an even distribution along the z-axis, so for each tree I give it a z-distance of, say, lerp(4, 400, treeNumber/totTrees).<br><br>Now because size decreases with distance according to a 1/x kind of curve, the visual end result is something like 1 or 2 trees up close, and a dense forest at the horizon. The tree that has distance 4 will get 1/4 scale, then 1/5 which is quite a bit smaller - but the difference between 1/294 and 1/295 is hardly noticeable - so it ends up looking like almost all the trees are at the same place way over by the horizon.<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308165909im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2016/03/29/hMUR.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>How do I assign z-distances so that the size decreases linearly? <br><br>I&#039;ve already tried a lerp(4, 400, Pow(treeNumber/totTrees, 0.2)) kind of solution, but then I end up with a forest up in the camera and another one at the horizon, and a barren field in-between. I want an even distribution (and yeah I know I technically have an even distribution and that this is how fields of view works, but I want a <i>visually </i>even distribution).<br><br>(oh and yeah, I&#039;m not adding a forest to Rain World, the question was <i>~cleverly obscured~</i>)<br><br>(..or was it?)

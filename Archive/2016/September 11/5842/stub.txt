Yeah it&#039;s definitely not intentional, believe me&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309163706im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/waaagh.gif" alt="Waaagh!" border="0"><br><br>Basically we&#039;re in the process of porting the code to PS4 and that&#039;s a tedious time consuming thing, plus scheduling a simultaneous release on steam and PSN with our publisher adult swim... there&#039;s only certain windows of time when everything works out for all the pieces that are in motion. We had one if we would have had all the code wrapped a few months ago, but we weren&#039;t happy with where things were at, so had to wait for the next one. <br><br>Even now, we *pretty much* have the code wrapped, but we&#039;re still polishing art and fixing bugs, so... yeah it&#039;s definitely going to be a much better, tighter game as a result of the extra time. It&#039;s not like it&#039;s just sitting around.<br><br>Thanks for patience!

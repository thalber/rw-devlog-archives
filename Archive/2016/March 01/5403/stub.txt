thats the intention! the game has had so much media exposure for so long, which is awesome, but as a result there was real concern about it coming out and people just being like &quot;yep, its still rain world, like we&#039;ve seen in 345987 gifs&quot;. so we&#039;ve been working super hard to subvert that and make sure the experience is fresh and surprising even for people who may have been following it closely. <br><br>does make for a boring devlog though im afraid :/

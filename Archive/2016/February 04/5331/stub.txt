Hi everyone! Really sorry, but I definitely spoke too soon about getting back to regular updates. It was deadline inferno there for a while, and once through we took a look at the schedule and... there&#039;s like 5 big secret things on there! So, very exciting stuff, but sadly I can&#039;t share it. You&#039;ll get to see it later!<br><br>James on the other hand has a weeeeeeeell earned month completely off from levels, instead doing what he&#039;s actually all about - music and sound. He says he has written several tracks already, though I haven&#039;t heard them yet. Pretty sure they&#039;re amazing though, as he claimed his artistic direction was More Weirder, which we can all endorse. <br><br>So, I&#039;m getting back at my mystery tasks. Will check in with you guys from time to time though!

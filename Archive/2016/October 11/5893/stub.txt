thanks all!!<br><br>Tiniest of updates:<br><br>The past weeks/months/lifetimes have been spent testing and improving the PS4 build with our porting team, Carbon Games. Things are looking REAL NICE <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309211844im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/eyebrows.gif" alt="Well, hello there!" border="0"><br><br>Its pretty crazy though: Joar is in Seoul right now, Carbon is in London, and Adult Swim is in Atlanta. Im in Boston organizing everything, and never sleeping because as soon as one crew calls it a day another timezone day begins! But everything is moving along quite nicely.<br><br>For international peeps, its official that we&#039;ll be releasing in a few languages: English, French, Italian, German, Spanish and Portuguese; which im very very excited about. I never expected things to get this big. <br><br>We plan on doing Asian languages eventually, but localization is going to take quite a bit for that and we&#039;ll have to redo our text system to accommodate, so it&#039;ll be down the line a bit. <br><br><br><br>Another cool thing now that content production is wrapped up is that I can start focusing on PR/media stuff. <br><br>For some that sounds like dirty words I know, but what I mean by it is putting together cool media to tease on the lead up to release. Were planning on a bunch of trailers showcasing different regions, gif campaigns that follow little narratives, &quot;music videos&quot; showcasing some of our favorite tunes in context, wallpapers and teaser art from Del. Super super psyched to get into all of that! (Especially since the last few months have been a tedious bug-testing hellscape, haha!)<br><br>But anyway, if anybody has things they&#039;d like to see or suggestions for that let me know and I&#039;ll take it into consideration!&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309211844im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/toast-r.gif" alt="Toast Right" border="0"><br><br>

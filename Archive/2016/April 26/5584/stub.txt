<b>Update 528</b><br><br>Scavengers can send out a &quot;kill squad&quot; to hunt you down if they really hate you, or if you&#039;ve transgressed an outpost, or both. Kill squads are not to be played around with - they will track you region wide and <i>wreck</i> you once they find you. <br><br>Personally, playing with these kill squads hunting me really revived the fun to my experience by introducing a tension I haven&#039;t had from lizards etc in a long time now. The lizards used to be worthy opponents that I felt cunning and smart when I managed to trick, but I&#039;ve gotten used to them. When reading the terrain I know where there might be a lizard and where there might not, and while they are still dangerous if I&#039;m being reckless, I have a sort of &quot;lizard safe&quot; play style where I just move between safe spots and very rarely am surprised by them. Also because of their somewhat limited ability to track you across several rooms, I know that if I manage to put some 3 rooms between me and a lizard I can basically count it out. <br><br>Scavenger kill squads, not so much! As they use ranged combat, the safe spaces in any given terrain are way smaller - I can&#039;t just jump from pole to pole to avoid them. Rather, when setting myself up with the challenge of traversing a region while being hunted, I&#039;ve found myself resorting to weird paranoid tactics such as moving stealthily between crawl spaces under the floor, or traverse the level up in the rafters rather than on the standard floor level, out of fear that they might suddenly pop up and throw a spear at me, approximately 1.2 seconds between my first spotting them and being dead. <br><br>If I&#039;m fighting back, I have to employ some weird rambo style guerrilla warfare where I stay hidden as much as possible to suddenly pop up and take out an isolated target. I had a really intense moment where I saw the squad enter the room, so I hid under the floor. Lying perfectly still I could see something like 8 scavengers gather on the floor above me, still unaware of my exact position but spreading out in the room looking for me. They were going to see me sooner or later, so when to initiate the violent rush for the exit? Tense! And extremely difficult - just getting from one gate to another in a well known region takes some 5 tries for me, who have played the game quite a lot over the last few years&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308170114im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/wtf.gif" alt="WTF" border="0"><br><br>Technically it works by the squad &quot;magically&quot; knowing where I am on the world map, and gravitating to that general area. They won&#039;t see me through walls once they&#039;re in the room though, so staying hidden is still a viable tactic. Originally I had a pretty purist approach to the AI not ever having access to information about anything it shouldn&#039;t actually know, but despite all my efforts the AI will always be pretty dumb compared to a human - so cutting them some slack by letting them know which general area to look in while still having to find you in the actual room felt like a good hybrid for keeping the suspension of disbelief alive while also promoting exciting gameplay. <br><br>It should be noted that this behavior from the scavengers will only be engaged in if you&#039;re consistently <i>really </i>bad to them, to the degree where their entire society declare you public enemy. So it&#039;s mostly a feature for experienced players who want to get some excitement out of playing a war-like run, or really really bad people who deserve the punishment&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308170114im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/evil.gif" alt="Evil" border="0"><br><br>On the brighter side, if the scavengers really like you, they can send out a &quot;chill squad&quot; which works basically the same, except that instead of spearing you on sight they&#039;ll hang out with you as you move through the region, and instead utilize their rocks and spears to protect you from whatever lizards and vultures might be on your tail. The chill squad is not as intense an experience, but it feels really nice to cruise around with your scavenger pack! I hope it will be a cool reward for the player that puts a lot of effort into building a good relationship to the scavengers.

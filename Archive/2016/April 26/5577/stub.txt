thank you! <br><br>yes, as the threat music ramps up it becomes more recognizably melodic / harmonic, and for some situational contexts. <br><br>its funny that you mention it, because we actually started with the concept of it being more-drone based, but for a variety of reasons that didnt quite work. then the original versions of the threat music loops were much more active melodically / harmonically, but we found that the ear wanted to follow the melody line or the harmonic progression so there was an awkward sensation when the music would fade in or out halfway into the loop. the percussion is great because it can be subtly ramped up or down without being too obvious, and is effective at building tension in a linear way. but if the player remains in a higher degree of threat, you&#039;ll hear a more fully assembled track. <br><br>this is all the layers from Suburban, which is the one that you can hear bits of in the video: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308170050/https://clyp.it/udj0xjnt" target="_blank">https://clyp.it/udj0xjnt</a><br><br>you wont ever hear all of them together, as there are 10 layers here and in-game system goes up to 5 layers, but the idea is that its something thats constantly shifting for each dangerous situation you encounter. there is a hierarchy for how the different layers come it and out, etc., so hopefully it never gets too stale (one of my biggest fears!)<br><br><br>edit: OH! a curious note about the high lead line on that track... each of the threat music &quot;songs&quot; have something like this, and its kind of supposed to be as if a slugcat is singing a lonely caterwauling tune XD <br><br>

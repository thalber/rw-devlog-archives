The full 10-layer complement of the tracks?<br><br>This track sounds amazing, by the way. Fantastic work.<br></div><br>probably the arranged threat music tracks, plus the other 130ish other &quot;regular&quot; tracks as well XD i honestly have no idea how thats going to work out yet logistically. maybe ill ship it on a hard drive or something, lol<br><br>thanks for the kind words guys!! im excited to finally be able to show some of it to you all&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308170114im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/toast.gif" alt="Beer!" border="0">

<b>Update 514</b><br><br>More work on scavengers, of course. Some general behavior brush up, making them work better in the world etc. As I talked about yesterday, they tended to get quite scattered in the world, I&#039;ve taken some measures against that by having them group up a bit more effectively. Also the problem where they perpetually fled back home was fixed - not by making them less afraid of everything which made their behavior really stupid, but just denying them exiting the world for a certain number of frames after being spawned. That leaves them to figure out what else to do, and interesting interactions can arise. They tend to save each other when in a pinch, and I&#039;ve seen them take down a lizard. Never a vulture though &quot;in the wild&quot;, only in a small test environment with those specific creatures spawned. <br><br>And a million other tiny things. Quite a lot of animation stuff actually, but pretty subtle. Some small reactions to stuff in the world, in an attempt to give them more &quot;soul&quot; and make them feel less like robots - stuff like a very slight vibration through the body upon hearing a sound, etc.<br><br>The most fun stuff is probably their new ability to point. If one of them spots a creature (you or vultures etc) that they&#039;re uncomfortable with, it can check what its team mates are up to - if they haven&#039;t noticed it they&#039;ll enter the point behavior. When a scavenger is pointing, all the others first look at it, then in the direction its hand/spear is pointed. They will have to actually see the target themselves though, it&#039;s not that the data is just copied AI to AI or something like that - so it should theoretically be possible to lie hidden and then reveal yourself to just one of them which freaks out and tries to tell its friends - all of whom don&#039;t see anything and don&#039;t believe it.<br><br>Animation-wise this might be a bit subtle to pick up, but the technical aspect is also important. In explanation I wasn&#039;t only after the cosmetic look, but also the actual behavior where if one of them spots you, the whole group will soon spot you as well. Seemed to make more sense than having one of them flee in panic or getting ready to fight or something while its pal is all mellow going through some trash.<br><br>In this gif you can see it if you look closely at the purple-eyed one. The ones up on the hill spot me and point at me, and then the purple eyed one looks first right then left.<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308164948im_/https://giant.gfycat.com/BouncyAthleticGnu.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>You might have to look at it a few times to pick it up. Sorry about letting the recording run, I just found it very funny with this particular scav chieftain&#039;s utter and complete lack of chill &gt;__&lt;

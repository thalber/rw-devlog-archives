Haha yep, garbage worms are going to get the bezier curves in their polish pass! <br><br><b>Update 529</b><br><br>Working some on alternate food sources. First up, pop corn!<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308170132im_/https://giant.gfycat.com/OnlyMadeupEider.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>These &quot;seed cobs&quot; require a spear to open. Once you&#039;ve opened one, you can eat your fill from it - it allows you to max out your food meter. However, once opened it will go stale (like the other two in the gif) for <i>many</i> cycles, I have the default set to 7-10, but it&#039;s tweakable on James&#039; end. <br><br>The idea is that these are sort of a limited resource where you have to make some interesting decisions - you can get free food, and all you need, now - but then you won&#039;t have it for later. So coming across one of these you&#039;ll have to ask yourself if you REALLY need it right now. <br><br>The ideal tactic I imagine is to be using them mainly when moving between regions. It has previously been sort of a problem that you manage to collect enough &quot;karma&quot; to pass into a neighboring region, but once through the gate you starve because you don&#039;t know where the food is in the uncharted territory. The alternative is to get some food in your starting region and then move out - but then the time pressure can be really rough. So with these, you&#039;ll be able to scope one out but save it until you&#039;re doing your rush for another region - then you can fill up before moving out, giving you a bit of a softer start in the next region.

yessssssss thats the plan! should be soon too. i just dont have a minute to devote to it until we get the PS4 stuff wrapped. <br><br>the game is Quite Large, and the only way for me to do a proper test is to &quot;speed run&quot; the game and take notes on performance issues, shader problems, wonkiness. I say &quot;speed run&quot; it in quotes because the fastest I, the person who made every room and region and know all the secrets and shortcuts, have been able to play to the win condition (skipping 3 regions!) is 8hrs. And that is ignoring all the narrative stuff and endgame content ofc.<br><br>ASG has people testing as well, but since a lot of this stuff is making sure that some shader effect in room 1367 is the right color and transparency, or this audio layer lines up with 4 others in the right way, its basically only me that can do it. So I run the game over and over every day as they update the builds, taking screenshots and video of the problems and sending it to them to tweak. this is my punishment for ambition!<br><br>but yeah as soon as this nightmare is over its time to update the fans and let them know the good news: rain world is coming...

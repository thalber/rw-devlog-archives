At first glance it shares a little similarity to the first half of the &#039;Utopian&#039; language of Thomas More&#039;s book Utopia, which was coincidently published 500 years ago this year: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308165056/http://www.omniglot.com/conscripts/utopian.htm" target="_blank">http://www.omniglot.com/conscripts/utopian.htm</a><br><br>Great answers from both of you on human (or otherwise non-human but equivalent) signifiers and the world/location in general. I think that the fact that this is a well thought out (and, of course, constantly evolving) process is demonstrable in the results - the abstraction (and thus the simultaneous alienation of the audience/slugcat) works, and adds to the mystery and intrigue of the world, ultimately capturing that hard-to-do thing of constructing a location as a character in its own right.<br></div>Thank you! And all kudos to James for the world building, he really is making it &quot;a character in its own right&quot;!<br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308165056/https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.msg1214128#msg1214128">Quote from: Canned Turkey on January 20, 2016, 11:18:17 AM</a></div><div class="quote">This game has crossed the line of being beautiful and motivating, to being so amazing that it&#039;s slightly demotivating because I&#039;ll never be able to make something like this.<br>I don&#039;t think the indie community will see something of this caliber again for a long time.<br>The only compliment I can give to you is that stuff like this is why I love games, and why I love making them.<br></div><br>Thank you for the amazing praise! Don&#039;t be demotivated - go pack to page one of this devlog and see for yourself what it used to look like.

The way I see it, &quot;talent&quot; is basically the same as creativity - having ideas and wanting to express them. That&#039;s what keeps you pushing through all those thousands of hours of work, and then you get better at the craft as you go. That part might be something you&#039;re born with, idk. For sure there are some people like that guy in count of monte cristo who got thrown in jail and made ink with his blood to be able to continue writing, and then there are people who have every opportunity and never create art. I for one am certainly not an ink-from-own-blood type, if I get sick or something I forget art and focus on surviving, but I&#039;ve always taken every opportunity to draw or write or whatever and I don&#039;t get tired of it ~ and do think that thing has contributed to the incredibly lucky situation I&#039;m in today, where I can work on this amazingly fun project full time (and then some)!<br><br>So if you really want to *make stuff* you&#039;d have to be in extraordinarily bad luck to not get good at it sooner or later, I believe. A very big part is knowing what you want to make. If you look at those screenshots Gimmy posted above here, you&#039;ll see that the artist basically had the idea for what style he was going for from the get-go, and those years were spent removing the stuff that didn&#039;t align with that style and exaggerating stuff that was in line with it (at least that&#039;s my interpretation). What&#039;s cool about it though is not the craftsmanship itself, but the stylistic idea which was always in there but which the increased technical skill made come alive in the later work.<br><br>That&#039;s my thoughts on creativity!<br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308165056/https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.msg1214167#msg1214167">Quote from: tortoiseandcrow on January 20, 2016, 01:39:17 PM</a></div><div class="quote">Re: save states - I might be in the minority, but it&#039;d be very important to me to be able to have multiple save profiles so that I can also play the game and not have wait until my wife is finished.<br></div><br>Noted&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308165056im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/hand-thumbsup-r.gif" alt="Hand Thumbs Up Right" border="0"> <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308165056im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/hand-thumbsup-r.gif" alt="Hand Thumbs Up Right" border="0"> <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308165056im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/hand-thumbsup-r.gif" alt="Hand Thumbs Up Right" border="0"><br><br><b>Update 517</b><br>Got another polished region with functional shelters and a gate between them from James, and spent the day getting save states to work on an inter-region basis. Seems to be working out! Lots of special cases to test, such as if you&#039;re in one region, go into another for a bit, then go back and save, will your map exploration progress in that swiftly visited region be saved? Etc etc etc. <br><br>Currently I&#039;m working on getting the map to display in the &quot;Sleep&quot; screen - we want to have it there so you can plot your next raid before actually hitting play and starting the rain counter. The problem with that is that in the sleep screen the world is unloaded, so can&#039;t easily ask rooms for their positions etc. I&#039;ve solved that by having the game process hand over a little batch of data to the sleep screen in its dying breath before being shut down, and that seems to be working out. Still a bit of fiddling to do, but hope to have something basic to show you within not too long!

#save files: Maybe we could have a system where it&#039;s possible to create different profiles, which would create potentially multiple &quot;Player progression&quot; object with &quot;save states&quot; - that would be really easy as I could just save to a few different files. Then you could have one for you and on for your sibling or whatever, and you wouldn&#039;t get each other&#039;s map exploration etc. Also you could create several ones for yourself I guess, but we do have some plans for allowing you to try different play styles within the same &quot;progression&quot; - that&#039;s basically what ng+ is gonna be for. <br><br>#asian signs: actually I was an exchange student to South Korea when initiating the project, so they are loosely based off of Korean hangeul writing <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309211642im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0"> Rain World has two distinct alphabets though, the other lending its aesthetic from cyrillic letters.

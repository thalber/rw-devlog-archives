totally! im taking an ear break, so let me tell you a little about the ambiance audio engine Joar has assembled.<br><br>Here is a snip of it in action. For the sake of clarity, its a super simple one i just put together from the Underhang region:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309163540im_/https://i.imgur.com/zTADPcs.png" alt="" border="0"><br>larger: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309163540/https://i.imgur.com/nqSniyS.png" target="_blank">https://i.imgur.com/nqSniyS.png</a><br><br>Might look a bit busy even so, but the concepts are pretty simple. Basically, there are 3 main types of sound objects that can be spawned: Omnidirectional, which applies a sound to the entire room; Directional, which pans a sound to the right or left side of the stereo field; and Spot which places a sound object along an X,Y coordinate. All of these are selected out of that large box on the right, which holds all the ambiance audio loops ive been creating over the past month or so, and any loop can be used as any type of sound object,<br><br>For Spot the player acts as a kind of microphone moving through 2d space, so the nested circles you see represents the area that a sound can be heard in. The inner circle is where the sound is at its peak volume (as chosen by the sliders in that objects option boxes that you can see on the left), and then fading out until the outer circle.<br><br>So between these 3 tools quite a lot of things can be accomplished, even in a simple form like here. Because you can spawn and blend multiple omnidirectional sounds, you can create a sense of shifting scenery as the player moves from room to room through the regions, giving a cohesive sense of space and aural geography; for instance winds growing stronger as you climb a huge structure, and the ground ambiance slowly fading away. By adding spot sounds to that you can bring to life the background environment: the hum of an old machine, bugs buzzing around a pile of rubble, howling winds on a little hilltop, etc. <br><br>I&#039;ll do a proper lil video when I hit a stopping point, but here at least is a clip i posted on twitter that shows 10 sec of moving through a sound environment with the audio devtools on so you can see whats happening: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309163540/https://twitter.com/RainWorldGame/status/698109778137124864" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/RainWorldGame/status/698109778137124864</a><br><br><br><br><br>Its super fun, but man did i set myself a huge task, as usual. Initially the idea was going to be to get general ambiance audio per region/subregion and throw in a few Spot objects here and there on certain significant objects to spice it up. But once you&#039;ve established a certain level of detail by adding the Spot sounds, theres no going back; the ear likes to hear the movement of the player through a dynamic sound world, so rooms / screens without the spot sound detail seem noticeably dull by comparison. So now i find myself having to go through all 1467 screens with laser attuned ears.... all in the span of 2 weeks or so. Absolute madness!!! But, its getting done. After i finish Underhang today, theres just one more to do.

Geez. The game has two regions that could be considered &quot;final&quot; regions, which one is more final depends a bit on your specific playthrough and how you count. They&#039;re Subterranean and Superstructure. I have spent significantly more than a month (working about 200%) on superstructure content.&nbsp; Now I&#039;m there again. James has also spent a month on it, but he says he will be passing over it at least twice again, maybe more. By now, superstructure has an insane amount of content. Not like, half the content of the game, but definitely, say... 6 times the content of a standard region. I hesitate to do the maths, but by the time we finish it we will have spent something like... 4 man-months on that region specifically. None of it has made it to the internet. The region is vast, but the sheer amount of stuff makes it a real problem to fit everything in in a way that doesn&#039;t become a complete cacophony and sensory overload from the very entrance room. <br><br>Not really sure what this post is about, probably just complaining&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309163540im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0"> But yeah, that region&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309163540im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/shocked.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0">

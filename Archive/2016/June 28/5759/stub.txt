ah, yes! this is true. the PS4 store illustration there is by Daniel Dussault. in a wild turn of events, we wound up in a situation where in order to make SONYs requirements for being at E3, we had to deliver a page on the PS4 store with certain very specific formatting, and have it done in *3 days*. Del was swamped working on in-game content, so Adult Swim swooped in and hired Daniel, who did seriously amazing work in such a short period. Maximum pro effort and massively appreciated.<br><br>im not sure of its fate though, as we&#039;ll likely want to keep Del&#039;s style at the forefront, so we&#039;ll see! but worst case scenario it makes for a very very nice placeholder!

Haven&#039;t really recorded any gifs of those, so they&#039;re lost to the wind I guess&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308165353im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/shrug2.gif" alt="Shrug" border="0"><br><br><b>Update 521</b><br><br>Working on the main menu. This might be stuff we don&#039;t really want to reveal yet, but I can say as much that we have a direction we&#039;re happy with and which we think works really well with the style of our talented illustrator Dell. <br><br>It looks like the game will feature two kind of distinct art directions, of course the pixelly style of the game itself, and then a more HD illustrated approach for the menu background etc. Getting the two styles to go together is going to be a bit of a challenge (especially in for example the sleep screen where they are going to meet - illustrated slugcat and pixellated map) but it should be possible to get to work, and when we do I think it&#039;s going to be a big benefit to the experience. <br><br>Whereas the flat-color pixels of the game are good for getting creature behaviors etc across, I think that the illustrations will do a really good job of complimenting that with giving a feel for the grit, grime, textures and smells of Rain World.

Anyone knowledgeable of fonts and/or pixel graphics around here? Menu work has forced us to start considering a font, but it&#039;s a bit difficult. A completely hard pixel font looks a bit rough - even though the game does only have hard edges, most of those are <i>moving </i>in a soft way, and the static jagged lines of a pixel font looks kind of harsh. On the other hand, putting an anti-aliased font on top of pixel graphics obviously makes the entire composition look like something a kid pasted together using random google images assets and ms paint <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308165353im_/https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/waaagh.gif" alt="Waaagh!" border="0"><br><br>Is there some happy in-between? I was contemplating the idea of a pixel font with 1 in-between color for AA, but maybe that&#039;s really bad for some reason? What are the general dos and don&#039;ts of game fonts? <br><br>(and yes I know I&#039;m supposed to be a graphic designer, but they never taught us how to do neo-semi-retro video games, just like... print and stuff...)

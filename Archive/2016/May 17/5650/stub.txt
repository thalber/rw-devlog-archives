I&#039;m sure it is the furthest thing from your minds now you are on the home stretch but I wondered in a related and roundabout way how moddable the game would be? It seems like things have become way too complicated for a super user friendly level editor - the levels and accompanying effects/AI mapping are way more intricate now so I imagine that is off the table, but I wonder what the scope will be otherwise? <br><br></div><br>ah yeah! for the level editor, its not so much the move to unity as 1. that it has to run on super outdated tech (instanced within Adobe Director), and 2. that it has become *insanely* complex and unintuitive at this point. We&#039;d likely need an equal amount of time to develop that for public use as the game itself! Also, since the game world has become so huge and factoring in the eventual multiplayer rooms and all of that... i feel like the last thing people are going to want is *more* maps, lol. But I could be wrong!

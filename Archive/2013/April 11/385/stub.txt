<b>Update 136</b><br>Today I made it possible to change the screen resolution from the menu. The game&#039;s resolution will always be 1024*768, but if you have a widescreen you might prefer black borders on the sides to a stretched image. <br><br>Also I wrestled for a bit with a glitch that has been around a long time. When you exit one room and enter another there&#039;s quite a bit of data for the game to load, and it&#039;s loading it all in one frame. For some reason Director has a thing where it pauses the sound if a frame drags on too long. This messes up James&#039; beautiful music tracks, the beat is broken by the hiccup. Today I divided the load so that some of the heavier parts are spread out over a few different frames. <br><br>The hiccup has become clearly shorter, and in some cases doesn&#039;t appear at all. The problem is the lizards mapping out what part of the level they have access to, for intricate levels this might take almost half a second per lizard. I&#039;ll see if I could possible divide it even more. It really helps the immersion to have the sounds play continuously across levels.<br><br>Oh, and here&#039;s my sketching up some logos:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141225164351im_/http://oi48.tinypic.com/118oa6x.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br><br><br><br>Here&#039;s the one I&#039;m most fond of right now:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141225164351im_/http://oi50.tinypic.com/2napd0n.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br><br><br>I&#039;m going to travel a little, so things might be a little slow here for a week. See you!

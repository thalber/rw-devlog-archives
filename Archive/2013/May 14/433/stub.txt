Yeah, you&#039;re absolutley right, it shouldn&#039;t be too anime. I don&#039;t want it to look like a pikachu clone.<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141223032123im_/http://oi44.tinypic.com/2is8lyx.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br><span style="font-size: 6pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><i>(Pikachu clones)</i></span><br><br>So this is what I did - 10 and 15 had a baby. Then I refined that some, and then I slanted the eyes. For the last one I changed the nose (good) and the jaw (not so good). <br><br>Still need to make it less anime... The creature in the game is not exactly cute, it has more of a strange, blank expression. If anything I want it to remind of a 1930&#039;s cartoon, I&#039;d like it to have a tiny touch of this:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141223032123im_/http://www.tvsinopse.kinghost.net/art/v/van-beuren-studios_arquivos/10010.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br><br>So... how can I make it less pikachu?&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141223032123im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/huh.gif" alt="Huh?" border="0"><br><br>Hehe @Jubjub, I know that the artist should leave the interpretation to the audience, but this time... I&#039;m sorry it has never been a mouth, it&#039;s a nose <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141223032123im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0">

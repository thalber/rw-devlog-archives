Hehe I don&#039;t really understand how you get killed by the rain, I myself always get eaten... In either case, it would be a lot easier if you were able to shelter in a few different places. Maybe there could be passages of very difficult platforming <i>between </i>those places though...&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141225164327im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/huh.gif" alt="Huh?" border="0"><br><br><b>Update 164</b><br>When the lizards mapped their accessable areas at the start of a level they would take their time, making a single frame that could be seconds long. That would make the music hiccup, which wasn&#039;t really making James&#039; work justice. Now I&#039;ve divided the area mapping over several frames. This increases the loading time for each level slightly, but gives the music a frame update now and then as a reassurance that the game is still running and the music should continue. From what I&#039;ve seen the music is playing smoothly now.

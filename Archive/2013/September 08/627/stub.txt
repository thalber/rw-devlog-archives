@ James - I&#039;ll be sending you an email, with a new version included.<br><br><b>Update 172</b><br>Implemented the sound wave readign system I mentioned yesterday. I open the sound files in soundbooth, make screen captures, and create 300*80px monochrome images of the sounds. A script then goes through all of those images, and creates a 300*1px image with 16 bit colors. Depending on the height of the wave in the previously mentioned image the corresponding pixel on the very thin image is given a color between (0, 0, 0) and (255, 0, 0) where the amount of red represents the volume. A looooot of manual work...<br><br>When the lizards growl, they keep track of where in their sample they are, and read the corresponding pixel color on the volumeMap, as I call the thin images. The redder the pixel, the more open jaw, the brighter the color of the head, and the more shaky motion. <br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141227105755im_/http://oi39.tinypic.com/28gxukh.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br><br>It looks a lot better, at least to me. The problem is that the system is not very dynamic, if James decides he wants to modify the sounds I&#039;ll have to sit through the entire process of screen capturing etc again - and there&#039;s a lot of room for errors to occur.

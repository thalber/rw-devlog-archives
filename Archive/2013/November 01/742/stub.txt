ahh back working on stuff im actually good at! <br><br>yeah the sound prototyper is going to be great. it functions sort of like an ad hoc audio middleware, and will allow me to make essentially entire cohesive audio builds that I can send Joar, rather than just give him little pieces of the audio puzzle to sew together himself. (Certainly you guys with your modern game engines will laugh at this &quot;why not use FMOD or WWISE?&quot; youll ask, not realizing that this game is impossibly built in macromedia director hahaha)<br><br>One thing that Im not sure has been mentioned on here is that, as much of the character animation is physics / AI based, there is often no &#039;standard animation&#039; for events, and thus by necessity much of the creature sounds are generative to one degree or another. Which is REALLY REALLY COOL. Despite collaborating on the generative audio for things like the lizard vocalizations, even I didnt know just how deep it all went until exploring with the sound prototyper and discovering subtle things like how the audio attached to <i>each creature footstep or wing flap </i> is actually generative within certain parameters. Pretty much everything heard in-world has aspects of randomness tied to the AI/physics behind it, which gives the game a deeply immersive, natural quality to it.

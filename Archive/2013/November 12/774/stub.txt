From you guys it sounds hopeful! Maybe donators could get the game two weeks in advance or something, as a gesture of gratitude. Or the impossible-to-use level editor could be included for them. Early access is another idea - then they could double as beta testers. Thing is though, I don&#039;t really want to beta test etc, I want to release and <i>move on</i>. But James has recently been trying to convince me that the game could be bigger, better, and maybe we should pursue that. The pups certainly are an epic feature creep. <br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141230111513/http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.msg966529#msg966529">Quote from: eigenbom on November 11, 2013, 08:01:44 PM</a></div><div class="quote">I imagine a patron/sponsor relationship could work like in the art world.

My prejudice is that the kind of eccentric old rich people I imagine doing something like this aren&#039;t all too interested in the indie game scene.<br><br>~$10k is about the amount of money I spend in... two life times, so if I could raise an amount like that I think that would be plenty enough to finish rain world and take me a healthy chunk into the next project. But, I might be optimistic.<br><br><b>Update 201</b><br>More pups following paths. Made a little &quot;training level&quot; with a lot of difficult situations (poles sticking out of slopes etc) and have just been having the pup run around chasing the mouse pointer - whenever it encounters a situation it can&#039;t handle I try to come up with a solution. <br><br>For most situations the AI actually looks at neighboring tiles and then emulate input, and then the input controls the pup through the remains of the original player code that are still hanging around. I can hijack this input and play the pup with the keyboard as well, for debugging. In some situations though, this doesn&#039;t really work. Either because the situation is too fiddly, with a lot of small, well coordinated movements, or because it&#039;s a situation that isn&#039;t possible to deal with given the pup&#039;s limited repertoire of movements. For example, while the player is able to balance on top of a horizontal pole, the pup is only able to hang below it. In some situation the pup isn&#039;t supposed to be able to go where the player goes (see previous posts), but in some situations it&#039;s just too annoying. For example if a horizontal pole connects with a platform just one single tile below the edge, it doesn&#039;t feel reasonable that the creature isn&#039;t able to climb that tiny distance to get up there.<br><br>For situations like this I&#039;ve created something that&#039;s called &quot;magic movement&quot; in the code, which is basically a cop-out when I don&#039;t know how to make something happen by simulating input. When entering &quot;magic movement&quot; mode it designates a position it wants to end up in, and what mode it should enter when it gets there (modes are thing such as &quot;standing&quot;, &quot;crawling&quot;, &quot;climbing&quot; etc). Then it just kind of floats to the desired location, at an even speed, with the force of gravity severely reduced. <br><br>This might sound like it looks bad, but remember it&#039;s just a question of moving one single tile. For a distance like this it could just snap into its new position and you&#039;d still be able to keep track of it, but I prefer to have this &lt;1 second cosmetic little movement going on. It&#039;s very useful for situations when I&#039;m not exactly sure of what to do to get the pup into the right position.<br><br>Once the movement is somewhat done, I&#039;ll work on the &quot;puppet&quot; of sprites that&#039;s rendered on top of the pup. Right now it&#039;s basically just the player graphics code, but with a smaller body, making it look like an adult bear creature with some horrible disfiguration. When I have some new spriting code I&#039;ll upload a gif of the pup moving around.<br><br>PS: working with the pup is fun, because I copied the code from the player and have seen some <i>oooooold </i>stuff that I had almost forgotten commented out in there. Like, today I found this piece that made the player able to <i>fly</i>, back from when he was a <i>bird</i> <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141230111513im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/cheesy.gif" alt="Cheesy" border="0"> RW has come a long way!

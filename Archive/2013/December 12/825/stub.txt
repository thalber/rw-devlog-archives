The black pup is my favorite. :D<br></div>Heh, you just saved him, he was going to be replaced, but now I think I might keep him. The colors will be yellow, black and green-ish, as it stands.<br><br><b>Update 211</b><br>Worked some on the pup AI. Instead of being hardcoded into special behaviours for lizard, players, other pups the pups are able to have a few template attitudes towards other enteties, NEUTRAL, FRIENDLY, FLEE and HOSTILE. <br><br>This means that in a situation where you kill one of the pups, the others might consider you something to FLEE from or be HOSTILE towards, and then the same AI as when those behaviors are applied to a lizard can kick in. <br><br>Here&#039;s a horrible chaotic gif of me and the pups spawning, with the pups having the &quot;HOSTILE&quot; attitude towards me.<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231163417im_/http://oi43.tinypic.com/f2vjer.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br><br>As you can see the green one is quick to grab a spear and kill me. The others are just trying to flee. You may also notice that the green pup doesn&#039;t throw the spear until there are no siblings between it and its target - me.<br><br>Now, a situation where the pups are hostile like this likely won&#039;t occur in the game, unless you murder one of the pups in front of the others while no lizards are even around. But the same behavior can, as said, be applied to lizards as well.<br><br>The pups have different personalities, and the green one is the violent, heroic and brave. When you find them he is holding a spear, and guarding the others. He always wants to carry a spear, and if he doesn&#039;t have one he&#039;ll pick up whatever weapons he can find around the levels. The HOSTILE behavior is more or less reserved for Green, he is the one responsible for protecting his siblings, and if the player betrays them or if a lizard is carrying a pack mate off towards its den he&#039;ll try to use his spear.<br><br>I&#039;ve actually had him &quot;rescue&quot; me once, when a green lizard was carrying me away he lodged a spear in its back. Sadly I was already dead, otherwise that would have enabled me to continue playing. <br><br>The other pups are also able to use weapons, but only in panicked situations when a pursuing enemy is getting too close. At this point I don&#039;t know exactly what their personalities will be, but I&#039;m contemplating having one of them sickly or injured, so you&#039;ll pretty quickly have to decide to get rid of it.

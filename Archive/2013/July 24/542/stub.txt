It doesn&#039;t sound much, but the game is getting complex, so there&#039;s a ton of things to think about when doing something like this, that &quot;breaks&quot; the game&#039;s original mechanics. A lot of things need to be handled, such as spears stuck in the lizard&#039;s body when it dissapears and so on. <br><br>After dying the lizard lingers for a bit, before starting to produce smoke. After a while there&#039;s enough smoke (hopefully) to cover the lizard&#039;s body, at which point it can dissapear without it looking too ugly. I&#039;m not too concerned about the way it looks, as lizards dissapearing isn&#039;t canon to the game world, it&#039;s just a fun feature for multiplayer. <br><br>Fateful to my tradition of ugly hacks the lizard will teleport to the bottom of the map, where the falling damage code will kick in, so I only have to write the respawn stuff once. The alternative would be setting up some kind of function that I&#039;d call from both the death-by-damage scenario and from the falling-out-of-the-map scenario, but as no-one but me will ever see the code this horrible solution seemed more convinient&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141223032109im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/tongue.gif" alt="Tongue" border="0"><br><br>I also added another setting for multiplayer, which disallows players from hiding in their holes; they&#039;re spat right out again. And I added a counter that keeps track of how long players have been alive during a match. Good for settling draws. These features will be fun for a new game mode I&#039;ve been contemplating - Survival. Survival won&#039;t be about catching flies, but will pit the players against each other and respawning lizards, without allowing them to hide in their holes, and the player that stays alive the longest wins.

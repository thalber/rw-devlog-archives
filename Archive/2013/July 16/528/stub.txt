This is definitely the last game I make in director, and with that perhaps the last game that ever gets made in director...<br><br><b>Update 151</b><br>Sorted out a lot of smaller errors. Added the possibility to have different &quot;control modes&quot; for when you play with game pads - for example the possibility that it doesn&#039;t register vertical input as long as there is horizontal input, so that you have to push up or down very deliberately in order to have the character react. As it was there was some trouble that the character would suddenly get into crawling position when you&#039;re running, because you happen to nudge downwards. This isn&#039;t a problem with keyboard controls, obviously - if you press a button you know that you&#039;re pressing that button.<br><br>Game pad users can now map a pause button, which takes them to the menu from the game. This means that if player 1 is on a controller, the entire game including menues will be playable from the controller, so that there won&#039;t be any need to touch the keyboard or the mouse.<br><br>Did a little work on the world map.<br><br>Also, the game has for the first time been played with three players. It seems to work fine!

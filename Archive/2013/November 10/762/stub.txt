What would be in it for the sponsor? I won&#039;t add dr. pepper power ups to the game hehe... Art grant is a really good idea actually! I should look into it.<br><br><b>Update 199</b><br>The second big mile stone of pup path finding done. Now it actually finds paths! I can click the mouse somewhere on the map, and it&#039;ll look for a path from that place to wherever the pup is at the time.<br><br>Pups probably have the most limited movement of all creatures in the game. They can run, climb, and perhaps jump a little, but they can&#039;t reach a ledge that&#039;s two tiles high. This is because I plan to make the player able to pick them up - they&#039;ll follow you, but some times you have to help them across some obstacles. <br><br>This means that their pathing map is a bunch of scattered islands that are not connected. For example, they might be able to move around on top of a specific platform, but not able to jump to the next platform.<br><br>So what behavior should they have when they&#039;re trying to reach the player, and the player is out of reach to them? It would be stupid if they did what lizards do in the same situation, which is basically &quot;screw it, I can&#039;t get there so I won&#039;t even try&quot;. <br><br>Say that you&#039;re up on a high platform, and you call the pup to come to you (more on communication with pups in later posts). There is a path from the pup&#039;s location that&#039;s unbroken <i>almost </i>all the way to where you&#039;re at. But before reaching you there&#039;s a big jump or something, that the pup can&#039;t do by itself but needs some help with. <br><br>In this situation it would be very stupid for the pup to just shrug and stay put. Frustrating for you, too. Instead, you want it to move to a position where you can help it. In this case, you&#039;d want it to move all the way up to that last obstacle, and then wait on the other side of it for you to come and get it.<br><br>The solution I have for this is that when the pup path finding crawls outward, it is not restricted to tiles that are walkable for the pup, but it always prioritizes walkable tiles. So, in the above example, the pathfinding will start at the player location (remember, I work from the goal to the start) and quickly flood the platform the player is standing on. Once the entire platform is examined, and the pup has still not been reached, it&#039;ll resort to flooding into un-walkable air tiles. After a few tiles of moving through the air, it&#039;ll connect to the walkable tiles on the other side of the gap. Once it has walkable tiles, it will always choose to explore those rather than un-walkable. So, it&#039;ll flood the walkable tiles, and reach the pup.<br><br>The pup will then have a path, though not a path that it can actually follow all the way. But, it will be the path were it gets as <i>closely as possible to where it wants to go, with the least amount of help</i>.&nbsp; It&#039;ll run along this path until it reaches the point where it can&#039;t proceed, and then wait. Unless the situation changes while it&#039;s running, which is pretty likely to happen with the player running around and all.<br><br>One frustrating situation that might occur is that the pup finds a path that leads to where you are, but that path takes it on a safari around the entire lizard-infested level. Like, you and the pup are standing next to each other, and you jump up the tiniest little ledge. Suddenly the pup decides that it can get to you through this <i>huge </i>detour, and you actually just wanted it to stay put. I don&#039;t have an immediate solution for this, but I can think of a few things. One would be that it simply doesn&#039;t bother to path to you unless you are a certain distance away. <br><br>The next step in the pup pathfinding development will be to make it actually follow the paths. That one also includes a lot of engineering of its movements, so that&#039;ll be interesting.

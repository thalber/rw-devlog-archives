Yeah, I prefer the vector art too, but the game isn&#039;t vector graphics... However, I could go with the solid color approach for the pixel versions as well.<br><br><b>Update 183</b><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141228124155im_/http://oi40.tinypic.com/2w4wb5k.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br><br>This typeface I&#039;ve got going works <i>a lot</i> better with some words than with other. &quot;Paused&quot; and &quot;Sand Box&quot; I&#039;m happy with, because they have a lot of chubby letters where I can but my X&#039;s. Words like &quot;Death Match&quot; and &quot;Complete&quot; are hopeless though, as they just end up a mess of spindly tentacles...<br><br>Edit:<br>Just spotted a comment on one of the youtube videos simply stating &quot;slug cats&quot;. I will never call them &quot;bear creatures&quot; again.

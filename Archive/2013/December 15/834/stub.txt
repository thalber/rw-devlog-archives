Yeah, the black could be the sickly one... only problem is that since it&#039;s the hardest to see, if it&#039;s also sickly, the choice of which one to dump first might get too easy.<br><br>The sickly one developing is interesting, but I won&#039;t ever be able to make them behave in a way that&#039;s beneficial to you <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231163417im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/tongue.gif" alt="Tongue" border="0"> I&#039;m just not good enough for that kind of AI.<br><br><b>Update 213</b><br>As the pups fleeing behavior was just too pathetic (running into a corner an shivering there) and fleeing behavior is one of the things you might actually want them to be able to do, I updated it a bit. The big difference is that they are able to move between rooms by themselves. <br><br>For each of the room&#039;s exits, a dijkstra map is created, mapping the distance from each pup-available tile to each exit, using pup-possible types of movement:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231163417im_/http://oi42.tinypic.com/b8r8k6.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br><br>When a pup is threatened, it looks at the dijkstra map values for the tile it&#039;s on, and the tile it&#039;s fleeing from. Then it can decide on which exits <i>it is closer to than the enemy</i>. If there are several, it can compare them, and go for the one where <i>the difference in distance is the greatest</i>. Then it&#039;s just a question of running! This is exactly the kind of fleeing behavior that the flies already use, but with hives rather than exits.<br><br>When reaching an exit, the pup object is put in stasis, and the pup is saved in the next room. Upon entering that room the pup is loaded, in a position that has roamed around the level a little bit, the number of steps determined by the amount of time since the pup was last seen. <br><br>When fleeing from players, this behavior is pretty fun. The pups run into another room, you follow, they run to another, etc. <br><br>If the pup is unable to reach any exits, or the enemy is between the pup and all reachable exits, it uses the old fleeing AI, which is horribly bad but at least enables it to move in somewhat the opposite direction. The bad AI running back and forth actually looks pretty cool in this new context though, because it only sets in when the pup is cornered, and it conveys a suitable feeling of panic.<br>

<b>Update 169</b><br>Multiple shelters system up and running - functionality wise at least, all the cosmetics aren&#039;t done yet. For example the shelters should probably have some kind of animated doors that close, and a more refined look. <br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141225164327im_/http://oi40.tinypic.com/2quus81.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br><br>What you see up top is the calendar. It shows all the days, white days are the ones where the rain stops and you can go out and play. You need at least one fly per day until the next hunting day in order to survive.<br><br>White flies are excess flies that are stored in this particular shelter. Grey flies are the ones you&#039;re carrying in your stomach. <br><br>What the gif shows is: The player enters a shelter. There are already 2 flies stored in this shelter. The player has 3 flies in his stomach. The days go by, and we reach the next hunt. Now this shelter has 1 fly in storage, the excess from the last hunt. <br><br>And yes, it&#039;s pretty much official that he&#039;s throwing the flies up on the floor in order to store them. Go check some biology documentaries, animals do stuff like that&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141225164327im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/wtf.gif" alt="WTF" border="0">

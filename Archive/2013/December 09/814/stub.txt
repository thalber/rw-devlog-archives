<b>Update 208</b><br>Ok, so here&#039;s why it&#039;s not a good idea to promise things in advance... You know those things I wrote about last time? I did some of them. Nothing new to write <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231042042im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/tongue.gif" alt="Tongue" border="0"><br><br>Actually what I&#039;ve been doing is making the pup an object that exists consistently between levels. Like, its position is saved when you exit a level, it can follow you to the next level, etc etc. It&#039;s also capable of some <i>very </i>abstracted movement when off-screen.<br><br>Generally if there&#039;s anything I&#039;m not extremely happy with in my game it would be how inactive the world is when off screen. Everything just goes into stasis, and is basically just saved as coordinates to later be loaded. This is because the game engine was originally written for a single-screen, multiplayer game - and when you maneuver between rooms it basically starts a &quot;new game&quot; for each room you enter. It has gotten a little bit more dynamic, and at least there is a pretty decent illusion that the entire world exists simultaneously, but part of that &quot;each room is a new game&quot; skeleton is still around.<br><br>Maybe I&#039;ll write a little engine that&#039;s capable of moving off-screen entities around and even have some very basic interaction between them. It&#039;s just a question of whether the current illusion of consistency is solid enough - it might be to a player that&#039;s not actually aware of what&#039;s going on under the hood.

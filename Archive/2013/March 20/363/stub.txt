Oh, wow!<br>I found out because my email was suddenly overflowing with notifications that people are subscribed to me on youtube... She says she hasn&#039;t been able to reach me, that&#039;s no good. I&#039;ll send her an email, I guess. Sooner or later I ought to make a website for this thing, so that stuff like reaching me won&#039;t be an issue.<br><br><b>To the people from Rock, Paper, Shotgun,</b><br><br>Welcome!<br>A few months ago I got the idea I should go to africa, and well, here I am. Because of this development of RW is somewhat slowed down, but I count on being back on a more regular schedule within a month.<br>Until then there&#039;s quite a lot of material back in the thread, if you&#039;re interested. Glad to have you on board!

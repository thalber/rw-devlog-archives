<b>Update 149</b><br>We&#039;re still stuck in UI hell, but at least something&#039;s happening. Because I don&#039;t seem to be able to create the design, I thought I&#039;d skip ahead to the raw functionality, and that has been working better. Here&#039;s the &quot;den screen&quot;, i.e. the screen you look at between levels:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141223032105im_/http://oi43.tinypic.com/9gysk6.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br><br>What&#039;s going on here is this - <br>Up left is the calendar, showing all the days you need to survive. The marked days are the days when there&#039;s a paus in the rain, hunting days. The player is just coming in from his fifth hunt. Down in the corner is the pile of bugs. As you can see, the pile starts at seven, that&#039;s the excess from the fourth hunt.<br><br>The player has caught 9 flies, these are added to the pile. Then the calendar starts to move, and 7 days pass. Each day one fly is removed from the pile (eaten or digested or whatever). Finally we arrive at the sixth hunt, with 9 flies still in the stock pile.<br><br>As you can see, this means that there&#039;s no need to go out hunting the sixth hunt, because there are only seven days until the next opportunity. This is true, and the game allows you to just go straight back in the den if you want to. I think I like the ability to hoard flies like that, it creates more freedom for the player to play with their own style. When you reach the very end of the campaign, your flies stockpile will be your high score.

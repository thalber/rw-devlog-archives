Even much of the music was to be an extension of the character: the beating of the heart, blood pumping through veins, hunger in stomach, etc.<br><br>But! Of course getting that to work AND be clearly understandable to the person playing it may take a bit of time and trial and error. Anyway, ive been thinking about all this for over a year, so im just happy to get a chance to finally talk about it&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229074531im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/tearsofjoy.gif" alt="Tears of Joy" border="0">

<b>Update 132</b><br>As the new menu and the game are now connected I&#039;ve started to mess around in the actual game a little bit again. Today I discovered that a problem I thought was solved was in fact not, which is always annoying. The problem is about the how the levels are supposed to have multiple entrances in custom mode, but only one when playing world mode. Because of this I set them up with an &quot;activeEntrance&quot; property in world mode, and shut down every other entrance, making them empty lizard holes. This works wonderfully when entering a level, and also when exiting it, if you exit through the leftmost entrance. If you exit through any of the others it returns an error which I feel perfectly confident I know what it is, but which has roots deep down in everything that has with inter-level connectivity to do. Which in turn makes me think that I should probably rewrite all that stuff...<br><br>But then again, I can always stack ugly hacks on top of each other <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141227105841im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0"> There&#039;s nothing like changing a problem of today into a problem of tomorrow!

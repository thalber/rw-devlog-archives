I&#039;m sorry this thread has been hibernating a while now - I&#039;m going home in a few days, and because I&#039;ve needed to finish a lot of stuff up before that date I&#039;ve been very busy. Once I&#039;m home the situation will be very different though (lots of time for development). You&#039;ll see the next update some time next week, when I&#039;ve gotten home and settled down after 7 months of africa.<br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141223032105/http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.msg910989#msg910989">Quote from: jonbro on July 02, 2013, 01:31:58 AM</a></div><div class="quote">I would happily take a more technical tutorial! that is awesome that you wrote up what you have already though, and it works somewhat like I suspected it did! Kinda sorta IK implementation. One question that pops to mind though, if you have a propulsion force that is based on the number of limbs down, but that is unpredictable, are all of the character speeds in the game unpredictable? Or is there some other driving force at a higher level? Also, are these the same systems that drive the player characters in the game?<br></div>I&#039;ll write one up for you! <br>The variable movement speed is only for the lizards, the player has a constant speed and the movement of the limbs is purely cosmetic. For the lizards though, the answer is yes, the speed is unpredictable. However they do have a weak propulsion force even when no limbs are connecting at all, to not get stuck.

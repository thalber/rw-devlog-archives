Yeah, I share your concerns. It seems like the game could be very mechanical and monotonous if you just speared the lizards one by one and then caught flies in peace and quiet. There&#039;s no need however to worry about the respawn rate of spears, because they don&#039;t respawn at all. Once you&#039;ve used it you have to retrieve it or go get another one.<br><br>The respawn stuff is interesting, and it made me think. I don&#039;t really want a megaman style respawn room, because I want to restrict respawning and saving the game world to the hibernation sequence. If I had a respawn like that I couldn&#039;t really save the game world, because if you went out again and &quot;deactivated&quot; the room as you describe, there would be trouble. Would objects you&#039;ve moved inside the room still be moved? Would the room be tagged as visited? Also, as I have a timer ticking when the player moves about, it couldn&#039;t really save the game every now or then or the player could get stuck with an impossible save. I could have two different save systems, so you could revert back to the start of the mission, but I prefer to keep it simple and I don&#039;t want interacting with menues to be a part of the play experience.<br><br>However, I can see two possible adaptions of the idea to fit my game. One could be that there could be shortcuts, perhaps one-way routes, to many parts of the map. That way you could very quickly <i>get </i>to most places, but you&#039;d still have to worry a little bit about going <i>back</i>. The other one is that there could be many different shelters, perhaps one per general area. That could also be interesting because it would save the extra flies you&#039;ve caught separately. So, for example, you might have 4 spare flies in one shelter and only 1 in another. Whether you survive or not depends on which shelter you go to.

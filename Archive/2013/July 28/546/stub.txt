<b>Update 155</b><br>Made portraits for the lizards for selecting them in the sand box mode menu.<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141223032109im_/http://oi43.tinypic.com/14lq5pl.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Since I&#039;ve already given up on keeping this devlog spoiler free, here are their descriptions as well (don&#039;t read if you wanna be excited by discovering them when playing the real thing):<br><br><span style="color: green;"><b>Green</b></span>: A slow and dumb creature - easy to avoid but tough to take down.<br><span style="color: purple;"><b>Pink</b></span>: A quick and intelligent hunter that will use vision and hearing to track you. Try to not let it spot you to begin with!<br><span style="color: blue;"><b>Blue</b></span>: This one can climb walls and ceilings. Nowhere is safe.<br><b>White</b>: A passive but deadly hunter. It blends into its environment and ambushes you when you&#039;re passing by.<br><span style="color: orange;"><b>Yellow</b></span>: Alone they&#039;re not much of a threat, but most often they hunt in packs - intelligently cooperating to track and kill you.<br><span style="color: red;"><b>Red</b></span>: A fast, strong and smart hunter with excellent vision and hearing. But what makes it most deadly is its persistance. Once it spots you it will never give up the hunt. Be aware!<br><br>EDIT: These descriptions will probably be in the menu, to add a little flavour. So if anyone wants to help out with the english that&#039;s appreciated.<br><br>EDITEDIT: Actually, whenever you guys spot some mistakes please point them out. For text that&#039;s going in the game that is, nitpicking my devlog posts would be kind of obnoxious <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141223032109im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/tongue.gif" alt="Tongue" border="0">

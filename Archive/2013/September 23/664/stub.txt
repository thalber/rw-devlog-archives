I hope they&#039;ll make it a bit easier to follow your player with your eyes when you&#039;re moving through the shortcuts. <br><br>The little spark that moves back and forth is there to show where there are shortcuts. It&#039;s not usually this frantic, as it mostly have other shortcuts as well to randomize through. But this level has only this one shortcut, and thus the spark is making the best of it.

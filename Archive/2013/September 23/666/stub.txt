I hope they&#039;ll make it a bit easier to follow your player with your eyes when you&#039;re moving through the shortcuts. <br><br>The little spark that moves back and forth is there to show where there are shortcuts. It&#039;s not usually this frantic, as it mostly have other shortcuts as well to randomize through. But this level has only this one shortcut, and thus the spark is making the best of it.<br></div><br>yeah that looks really nice, especially on the larger levels! its something that would never have even crossed my mind (hey thats why im not a visual artist!) but somehow subtly&nbsp; adds to the atmosphere. the result feels more techno/&quot;city-like&quot;. same with the slight change in gradient you used for the backgrounds.

If that&#039;s the case, then that&#039;s amazing! I guess you&#039;re right in that the gaming world, especially the indie one, is very different today. <br><br>And if it&#039;s like you say, that people <i>want </i>to give money to the projects they enjoy, then I&#039;d certainly enjoy recieving some of that money. If not for anything else, at least because it would be proof that people enjoyed my work <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141223032125im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0"><br><br>Still, I remember when I was a kid and me and my friends used to play games during lunch break - if you had to pay, or if there was any kind of hassle, we would simply treat that game as non-existent. We played only stuff like Liero, that you could download in less than a minute and be playing in less than two. <br><br>I don&#039;t know... In the end, I&#039;m pretty much decided in that there will be a way to download and play the game for free. But if there are people who want to give me some money, there should definitely be some way for that to happen too. <br><br>James, you and I have been talking about this before, but I don&#039;t remember what we settled on? Donations?<br><br><b>Update 142</b><br>Made it possible to re-map the keyboard controls. The excitement! <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141223032125im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/yawn.gif" alt="Yawn" border="0"> Still it&#039;s cool to see how these things are coming together. I could make my way through the menues with the mouse, change the controls for player 1, make my way back with those new controls, start up a custom game, hit esc, see how the menu reacted to player input, go back to the menu, etc. It&#039;s a flow of... working stuff, which seems awesome in comparison to the separate shards this project has been up until now.

Hahaha never in my life would I suspect so many people would <i>ask </i>to pay for something!<br>What about kids without credit cards, then? Or maybe stuff has changed since I was a kid, I guess these days they get their weekly allowance in bitcoins or whatever. <br><br>Perhaps I could make the game accessable in two ways: either you pay what you want (even 0), or (if you&#039;re a kid, or flat broke) you can send an email explaining why you can&#039;t pay for the game, and I&#039;ll send an email back saying &quot;no worries buddy&quot; and the game attatched.

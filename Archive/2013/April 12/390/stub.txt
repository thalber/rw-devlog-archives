ahh cool! im no visual artist, but i personally like these, because of the legibility AND because is looks sort of like some of the in-game environmental elements: <br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141225164351im_/http://i.imgur.com/cYxWx6t.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141225164351/http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.msg874183#msg874183">Quote from: JLJac on April 11, 2013, 12:35:24 PM</a></div><div class="quote"><br>Here&#039;s the one I&#039;m most fond of right now:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141225164351im_/http://oi50.tinypic.com/2napd0n.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br><br></div><br>this one the stylization is really really cool BUT its a little illegible... &quot;pain world&quot;. I think if its cleaned up just a bit it will look pretty awesome though.<br><br>One odd thing that I have an opinion on is having the lizard on the titlescreen. This may be just my silly opinion, but for some reason, I think it might spoil the spookiness of the first few lizard encounters by being confronted with it when you first start up. I liked having the initial impressions being about the bear and the environment and rain, with the lizards being this kind of lurking unknowable death in the shadows. Makes them more terrifying IMHO.<br><br>just my 2 cents!

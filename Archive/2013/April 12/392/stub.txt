Hm. The lizard thing is a really good point. Perhaps the title screen could show off some more environment instead - it could still feature the &quot;growers&quot;(I hesitate to call them plants) that are a pretty iconic element of the RW environments.<br><br>The legibility issue is also something I should look at. The R should read R, for example. I think the type might need to have some more work done on it - it can most likely be made made more legible while retaining some of its graffiti-ish aesthetic. The drooping I versions are much more legible, but to me they look a little to &quot;fantasy&quot; and lack a certain &quot;early cartoon&quot; kind of vibe that I really appreciate in the other one.

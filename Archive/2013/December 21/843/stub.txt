<b>Update 215</b><br>Ugh... One of those days.<br><br>James wanted me to make a t-shirt that could be used as a kickstarter reward, and because a t-shirt probably should have a logo on it I decided to revisit the text elements of the game. After all there has been some talk back and forth about that, so it could use a little improvement. <br><br>There is a little bit of a tribal theme going on in rain world, or tribal industrial you could probably call it. <br><br>Look at this level, for example.

What could I do with tribal/industrial?<br><br>So then I had this brilliant idea, that I would draw inspiration from mayan writing, mix it up with graffiti, and make &quot;if mayans developed to the modern and post-modern age, did graffiti, and that graffiti was rendered through pixel art&quot; kind of typeface. With roman letters. There&#039;s no way this could fail, right? <br><br>I started out being kind of happy with my work. It looks mayan, it looks a little graffiti and a little high-tech. Sweet, this is going to be awesome. I&#039;m already planning all the new art assets for the game, including mayan runes in 3D and mayan high tech gargoyles to stick to buildings, etc etc.<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231163420im_/http://oi39.tinypic.com/2s6veqa.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Then I try to move the linework to photoshop and give it color. Now I encounter the problem. If I want it to be somewhat legible, I have to fill in the main letter shapes, and leave the little beads and dots and stuff as they are. Or at least somehow put the letters apart from the decorations. <i>But</i>. Filling in shapes takes away from their mayan look, because the mayan look is more or less based on it being only line work, no solid areas, and all the lines being of equal thickness. Finally I manage this:<br><br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231163420/http://oi40.tinypic.com/2d9btox.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231163420im_/http://oi40.tinypic.com/2d9btox.jpg" alt="" width="512" height="384" border="0"></a><br><br>And realize I&#039;ve wasted two days&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231163420im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/lipsrsealed.gif" alt="Lips Sealed" border="0"> Contrast the old logo:<br><br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231163420/http://oi44.tinypic.com/r1muxe.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231163420im_/http://oi44.tinypic.com/r1muxe.jpg" alt="" width="512" height="384" border="0"></a>Â¨<br><br>and you&#039;ll see that it is both more legible, and cooler looking, which makes this new mayan adventure kind of meaningless. I haven&#039;t given the mayan typography all the finish I could&#039;ve, but I think it&#039;s not really needed, it&#039;s painfully clear that it doesn&#039;t work.<br><br>Back to the drawing board.<br>

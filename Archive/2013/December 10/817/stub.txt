Hi and welcome! <br><br>The difficulty is actually the games&#039; biggest issue right now, IMO. The game single player campaign doesn&#039;t really suffice for the type of game play you describe, where you get into a comfortable pace of finishing levels one by one - rather I want you to have to retry each hunt a few times before you make it through. The problem is that right now you have to retry waaaay to many times. I&#039;m looking into ways of making it easier.<br><br>Multiplayer mode offers some replayability, I think. Me and my cousin have logged many many hours of competitive play during the development of the game, and we are not really getting tired of it. Which may be because the game has been developing and changing, of course <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231042042im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0"> <br><br>The thing with the pups is actually that they <i>don&#039;t</i> help you. They are there as my take on a &quot;story&quot;, taking care of them is an optional side quest, and the only quest in the game except staying alive yourself. So if you don&#039;t want to be bothered, you can just ignore them. Actually an important part of the narrative will likely be that you can&#039;t save all three of them, but will have to prioritize. I think it would be interesting to have events like that, and the decisions are <i>yours</i>, ie not a pre-scripted cut scene. <br><br><b>Update 210</b><br>Misc pup stuff. What happens when a pup is off-screen holding an item? What happens when you enter a short cut, with a pup in the piggyback-position, and the pup is holding an item? What should it look like when a pup is carrying a spear? Etc etc.

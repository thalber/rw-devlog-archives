@Jubjub: Thanks!<br>@James: Hehe I promise you, if this brings in enough money to make a stuffed toy, then we&#039;ll do it, even if it puts us back to 0! Plushie dolls always pay back tenfold, rule number 73 of capitalism.<br><br><b>Update 143</b><br>Work has totally flooded me these last couple of days, which is, for some strange reason, no only a bad thing. When you can&#039;t get the time to work on your own projects you tend to be thinking about them in the back of your head, and when you suddenly get that one hour of precious free time you make <i><b>power progress</b></i>&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141223032123im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/hand-thumbsup-l.gif" alt="Hand Thumbs Up Left" border="0"> <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141223032123im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/mockangry.gif" alt="Mock Anger" border="0"> <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141223032123im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/hand-thumbsup-r.gif" alt="Hand Thumbs Up Right" border="0"><br><br>Yesterday&#039;s power progress included hooking players up to their controls, changing the input system so that hard-coded uglyness was taken out (at one point I just wrote &quot;if keyPressed(&quot;K&quot;), completely ignoring whatever controls the player had set up. Seriously.) and making it possible to activate and de-activate players for the custom game type. For the first time ever I spawned four players on&nbsp; a level:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141223032123im_/http://oi41.tinypic.com/3tsmw.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br>(Player colors are subject to change, perhaps)<br><br>It seems to work. Then there are of course two different kinds of &quot;work&quot;, one means &quot;doesn&#039;t stop and throw error messages in your face&quot; and the other means &quot;plays well and is balanced enough to work as a game&quot;. The second of these I know nothing of at this point. But the lizards don&#039;t seem to be too confused, at least.<br><br>Next up is game pad support, which is going to be interesting as I&#039;m in africa and I don&#039;t have a game pad. My idea is that I&#039;ll copy the code line by line from Block Towers, and then send a version to James to try out. We&#039;ll see how it goes. Worst case scenario I&#039;ll have to postpone the game pad stuff until I get home in two months. <br><br>I think the fact that I actually accept that the game will not be finished and released in eigth weeks time reflects some kind of new found maturity - the last year I&#039;ve continuously been beliving that I&#039;m in the last two weeks of development. Still, at this point it might be a reasonable estimation to say that the remaining devlopment is closer to two months than it is to a year.&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141223032123im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/grin.gif" alt="Grin" border="0">

I&#039;ve been avoiding yellow for some reason... don&#039;t quite know why &nbsp;<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141228124136im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/droop.gif" alt="Droop" border="0"><br><br>Mostly it was a matter of conveying what&#039;s going on to the player, with the big difference being that the new holes show direction, as they&#039;re not perfectly square. Hopefully this makes it a little easier to piece together what&#039;s happening from looking at those pixels. <br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141228124136/http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.msg948149#msg948149">Quote from: Belimoth on September 23, 2013, 01:04:20 PM</a></div><div class="quote">So does the shortcut not exist in the physical space?

To the game engine the shortcuts are objects you interact with that moves your body out of the level, and then it walks tile by tile looking for another tile with the shortcut property until it hits an exit, then it reintroduces the player to the level.<br><br>The in universe explanation is more fuzzy... It&#039;s obviously some kind of pipe that the creatures move through (physically, it&#039;s not a teleporter). It&#039;s one of those places where game design meets world building, and the most obvious parameters of world building has to give way. I don&#039;t think those places are necessesarily akward though, they can give a touch of surreal quirkyness to the world that actually enriches it.

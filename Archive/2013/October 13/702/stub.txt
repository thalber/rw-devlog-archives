whoa! having the lizards deflect spears front on is going to hugely change things. I&#039;m scared already! you&#039;re totally right that at present it was basically &quot;find spear, go on lizard skewering rampage&quot;. Maybe an idea to keep it &quot;easier&quot; at lower levels would be to have the spear damage done to the head be a random figure within certain percentages, and lizard types that appear earlier would just have a higher chance of scoring a higher percentage hit. that way it&#039;s not TOTALLY impossible if you somehow have to face one head-on, just more threatening.<br><br>I would say that even as it is now, it&#039;s not &quot;easy&quot; by any means. it seems to take at least 2-3 spears (or a thorough pummeling with rocks and things THEN a spear) to take down a lizard, and often you will be chased by 2-3 lizards, so that&#039;s still some skill to pull off as spears aren&#039;t terribly common in the wild. But I think the idea is really good. <br><br>When I first started playing, I don&#039;t think that spears were implemented yet, so sneaking around a lizard to hunt those last few flies with time winding down was palm-sweating and nerve-wracking, but also probably the most intense/fun id had gaming for a while. the satisfaction of when you DID finally kill a lizard, by tricking it into falling off something, or some other trick, was HUGE. sort of like in half-life two when you finally destroy that first helicopter that has been dogging you. so if this brings more of that atmosphere back into the late game stuff, it&#039;s a great development.<br><br>Also, I really love the match complete screens! Like many, I think the last panel seems to work the best, with the clean white/ bold black stroke lettering. I think because the font itself is already so complicated visually, the gradients and lighting and all that of the other 3 just makes it too fussy to read.

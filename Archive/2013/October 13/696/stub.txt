Thank you for your constructive feedback. You&#039;re not too harsh at all, this is exactly what I want to hear. It takes an outside perspective to spot some things. For example I didn&#039;t really know that Competitive was illegible, but now that you mention it I can totally see it.<br><br><b>Update 185</b><br>Today I pasued from the font stuff, and did something that I really don&#039;t know about... I had this idea that the game had become too much about just feeding spears to the lizards, and I wanted to get some of the fun back that was present back before the spears, when the game was much more sneak oriented.<br><br>So I made the lizards have hard heads. That means, if you hit them in the head the spear bounces off.<br><br>Basically the idea is that if you hit them in the body you do 4 times as much damage as when you hit them in the head. If you manage to hit them in their open mouths though, you get a damage bonus.<br><br>This makes the game like 100 times as fun to me, as an experienced player. Suddenly I can&#039;t just wait at a ledge for a lizard to peek over it and then throw a spear at it. All the dull tactics of just sitting somewhere with a spear in hand and waiting for them doesn&#039;t work any more. Instead I have to out think them, create manouvers, trick them into a narrow opening and attack them from behind. In close quarters I need to use wit rather than brute force. In open areas I need to pull off twice as impressive action manouvers. Like climbing up a pole, having the lizard climb after me, then drop down to the side of the pole and on my way down lodge a spear in the side of the lizard. It&#039;s much more in line with what the game was originally supposed to be about, which is interacting with and outsmarting the AI.<br><br>The problem is that this makes the game a loooooot more difficult. And that&#039;s not what I needed. However, the idea was never that the difficulty would be defined by how easy it was to kill lizards, as the game was never supposed to be about killing lizards, but about avoiding them. The only thing this actually changes is that spears are less powerful. And spears weren&#039;t supposed to show up until like halfway through the campaign either way, so maybe it won&#039;t make the difficulty curve that much steeper?<br><br>I don&#039;t know... On one hand it&#039;s so refreshing to once again have to put some thought into what you&#039;re doing when you&#039;re playing. On the other hand it feels like it&#039;s akward to introduce yet another rule that new players have to learn (they need to be attacked from behind). On the third hand ( <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141228124155im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/hand-money-l.gif" alt="Hand Money Left" border="0"> <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141228124155im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/hand-fork-l.gif" alt="Hand Fork Left" border="0"> <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141228124155im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/cool.gif" alt="Cool" border="0"> <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141228124155im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/hand-metal-r.gif" alt="Hand Metal Right" border="0">) the game wasn&#039;t ever really supposed to be about killing lizards with spears. Out of nowhere I decided to add spears, so why shouldn&#039;t I be able to nerf them out of nowhere as well?<br><br>&nbsp;<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141228124155im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/huh.gif" alt="Huh?" border="0">

@artemi, actually I think of it the other way around - single player is Canon, and the rules there are the official rain world rules. Multiplayer sometimes deviates from that, because of Fun. I also expect the player to play single player first, then multi player. <br><br>The single player rules of friendly fire is that everything hits everything, whether you like it or not. RW doesn&#039;t have a health meter for players, just dead or not dead, and stunned. Rocks stun you for a while, spears kill you. Note that in single player none of these effects are wanted, as the you are on the same team. <br><br>In multiplayer you can switch spears off, which means that rocks still hit, and spears still hit lizards, but spears don&#039;t hit players. This is because the insta-kill spears tend to makes competitive games rather short, but you might still want to be able to use them on lizards. That&#039;s not Canon, it&#039;s just Rule of Fun.<br><br>@bandreus, this is yet another game vs simulation situation. As you say, it would make logical sense for them to pursue pups before players. On the other hand, from a game perspective, you want to be able to lure them away from the pups. If they follow a pup, you have an interaction between two AIs that you&#039;re not able to change, there&#039;s no &quot;play&quot;. If they prioritize the player, you can save the pups by playing well - your actions matter. <br><br>Maybe the best balance would be to have them prioritize players and pups equally. But I really like your suggestion of having them differ depending on color as well. <br><br>@Dayvi, the consequences are not that grim, the &quot;punishment&quot; is only very temporary (the pup being stunned a little while) so in this case I don&#039;t think it&#039;s very unfair. If you hit them with a spear though... <br>&nbsp;

<b>Update 127</b><br>Tried to create a little bit of order in the complete and utter mess that&#039;s Rain World menu and options code. I have so much stuff from the old preliminary menu hanging about, together with three or four different solutions for everything, some preliminary, some not finished, others inbetween. Now things are starting to be reasonably tidy, at least to the point where I can understand what I&#039;m looking at. I have a somewhat logical way of storing the state of the main menu, i. e. what options were selected, what pages were up and so on. <br><br>To give you a taste of what&#039;s up, imagine the following: For most game types there are two options that should be controlled by the player. These are the Spears option, which indicates whether or not spears will appear on the levels, and the SpearsHit option, which decides whether or not a player should be able to hit another player with a spear.<br><br>Now, these options need to be set and stored individually for each game type. If I change them in one game type&#039;s options page I obviously don&#039;t want them to be changed for all the other game types as well, I want to be able to custom tailor my play options for each game type.<br><br>At the same time, there&#039;s another factor of complexity - that some gametypes should forcefully override these options. For example, in the competitive game type you should be able to decide whether spears hit players (it has a huge effect on the gameplay, making the difference between a game where you try to outsmart each other and catch flies and one which is about fast reflexes in quick, brutal duels). In the cooperative game type I might not want this option to be available, because fighting lizards together becomes way too easy when you don&#039;t have to worry about hitting each other.<br><br>So, I need to store a lot of options separately, and I need to be able to override options, both of which I need a logical, reasonable system for which doesn&#039;t tie my brain up in a knot every time I look at it. <br><br>As I&#039;ve mentioned, programming UI:s isn&#039;t at all my favourite thing. It&#039;s a lot of hard work, and you don&#039;t really get anything spectacular out of it. The greatest possible achievement for an UI is &quot;not annoying&quot;, which seems like a not too exciting purpose to strive for. I&#039;ll get there though, as it&#039;s a necessary step in making all the good aspects of the game visible.

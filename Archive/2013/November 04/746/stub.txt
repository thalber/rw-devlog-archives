Hi! A while back Chromanoid posted a summary of the technical stuff I&#039;d written up until that point. I haven&#039;t really said anything significant since, so check it out,.<br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141230111424/http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.msg920787#msg920787">Quote from: Chromanoid on July 22, 2013, 11:27:00 PM</a></div><div class="quote">click the link thingie ^<br></div><br>@Artemi, I&#039;ve been thinking myself about stuff such as tagging tiles as &quot;dense plants&quot; so that you would move slower, and other ideas. But since the plants are drawn into the level, they are not able to move, and it would looks strange if you interacted with them but they where completely static. So instead I&#039;ve decided that the plants are never going to affect or interact with the player. There might be some deviations from that rule though, we&#039;ll see how it plays out.<br><br>Level color is different between areas, but the largest area by far is the one that&#039;s colored in the bluish grey you&#039;ve seen in most screenshots. All levels may have 2 &quot;effect colors&quot;, which are used to color plants etc. Plants can also be set to &quot;dead&quot;, in which case they don&#039;t use effect colors. <br><br>The weird different fonts is an issue, yes. The grafitti/sign difference doesn&#039;t bother me much, because that&#039;s the way grafitti appears in real life as well; next to some sign with a industrial very proper san serif. But then Rain World has an asian looking alphabet as well, making the different writing styles as many as three (if you don&#039;t count the anonymous san serif in the menues). That might be a bit too much.<br><br><b>Update 193</b><br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141230111424im_/http://oi40.tinypic.com/4q55qw.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br><br>More work on procedurally generated plants. This one is called &quot;feather fern&quot;, and uses the same base code as the spraw bush. I don&#039;t know if I&#039;m very happy with it yet... This is hard, takes a lot of iteration. At least it&#039;s nice to see 3D plants rather than completely flat stuff like I had before.

<b>Update 176</b><br>Resolved a lot of small issues. For example I made it so that objects (rocks, spears) can&#039;t occupy the exact same space - when they go to &quot;freeze&quot; mode they do a check for other objects, and if there are objects too close they don&#039;t freeze but instead moves away and try again. Also, when spears are stuck in the ground close to a wall they tend to lean out from the wall rather than in towards it, in order to make them more visible. Small stuff, but it makes the game more pleasant to play.<br><br>Also I&#039;ve messed around with the menu for Waves mode, so that it has no options or anything, just a list of levels you choose from.<br><br>Waves mode is a bit addicting, so I tend to start playing it rather than making progress... I&#039;ll have to stop with that. It works OK, but there&#039;s some trouble with it very suddenly throwing a very big challenge on you, such as three white lizards and four blue ones or whatever. It feels a bit harsh when you&#039;ve done well up until a certain point, and then you&#039;re just annihilated by an army of four sticky-tounged, camoflauged, wall climbing white lizards. It has to be a little bit more aware of the steepness of the difficulty curves it creates.<br><br>Edit: Did the dynamic area mapping speed thing. So now when you kill ALL the lizards on the screen at once, it takes a bit longer for them to respawn because they each map their turfs slower, but it doesn&#039;t lag. Also resolved the issue with the difficulty spikes - now when a new color of lizard shows up it is guaranteed to be alone on the level the first time you see it. So for example, from the third wave on there&#039;s a chance blue lizards might spawn. Then, during the third wave, the blue lizards will always be alone - they won&#039;t spawn unless everything else is dead, and nothing else will spawn while they&#039;re alive. In the next wave, the fourth, the blue lizards will be allowed to haunt the level together with one other lizard, whatever color it is. In the fifth wave, it is allowed to co-exist with two other lizards. Etc. This way there won&#039;t be any situations where you&#039;ve never encountered blue lizards, and then surprise mofo, here are three of them, together with a white!

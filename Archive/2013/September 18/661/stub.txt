Artemi, that&#039;s a really good guess! <br><br>The first four of the square buttons are lizards - currently one green is active, but you can have 4 reds or whatever, you just click them to cycle through the colors. The fifth button toggles lizards respawn, it&#039;s currently on. On the next row is eggs, allowed in holes, many players allowed in the same hole, spears (off, on, spawning at random, or available in holes - the last one currently choosen) and then friendly fire on/off.<br><br>See where it says &quot;Levels&quot;? That&#039;s the level tier - currently it only has one level on it, confusingly named &quot;Levels&quot; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141228124136im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/tongue.gif" alt="Tongue" border="0"> If you move the cursor out to the left a list of all levels pops up, and when you click these they&#039;ll appear on the tier. You can have up to 10 levels on there. Under the level tier are four little buttons: clear tier, shuffle on/off, recommended levels (for this gametype), and cycles. Cycles makes the game repeat levels, so if you put it to 3 it will play each level 3 times.<br><br>The five circles are match length options - 1, 2, 3, 6 or 12 minutes. Then flies density, and finally the little cross which resets all options to the gametype default. The little bear creatures can be clicked in order to toggle players on/off.<br><br>And this whole thing is controllable with mouse, keyboard AND gamepad! The menu truly is my greatest achievement with this game&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141228124136im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/epileptic.gif" alt="Epileptic" border="0"><br><br><b>Update 179</b><br>Got rid of some harsh gradients in the background, to give smooth surfaces and curves a smoother look. Lighter one is new:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141228124136im_/http://oi40.tinypic.com/a31qo4.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Notice how there was previously some very sharp vertical lines on the big pipe in the background? Now they&#039;re slightly less sharp, and I think the whole thing is a little easier on the eyes. Also the slightly lighter colors create more foreground/background contrast, which might be good for gameplay purposes.

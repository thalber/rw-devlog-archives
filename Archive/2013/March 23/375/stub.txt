Thank you all for being interested!<br><br>The game is created in Macromedia Director and written in Lingo (At first I considered writing the game in iron-age runes on stone slabs, but then I settled on going with a slightly older and more traditional development environment). <br><br>It&#039;s very hard for me to estimate how far through development I am, as I&#039;ve made the estimation &quot;50%&quot; about seven times already. Today I am definitely beyond 50% though, as pretty much the only things I can think of are: The menu, some more art, four-player support, joystick support and the menu art. If not on the final 10% I&#039;d say I&#039;m somewhere in the final 20-30.<br><br>At this very moment I&#039;m living under very african conditions (I can literally see goats outside my window when writing this), which I have taken as an excuse to keep development on hold. Fact is I probably just really needed to take a break from the project, after one year + of development.<br><br>Very soon I&#039;ll move from the small town to Accra, and start at a desk job and live in an apartment. Then I&#039;ll try to get back to a strict minimum 1 hour a day schedule. Likely things will go quicker than expected then, as I&#039;m fully confident in how to do all the remaining things that have to be done, it&#039;s just a question of sitting down and doing them.

Hm, that&#039;s very interesting. The very first thing that went through my head reading that was &quot;if not for mistakes, then what should I punish the player for!?&quot;&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231042030im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/cheesy.gif" alt="Cheesy" border="0"><br><br>In one way I think you&#039;re right. In one way I think you&#039;re not. It&#039;s interesting. I guess it is, as all design choices, a good or a bad design depending on what you&#039;re designing. If I we&#039;re making a futuristic racing game, that was all about the super smooth, trance-like flow of gameplay, I would totally agree with you. Then it would be all about designing an experience around the player, and that experience should be as slick and enjoyable as possible, with no weird annoying things happening such as mistakes having consequences.<br><br>Now, on the other end of the spectra we have dwarf fortress. I&#039;ve always thought DF is kind of awesome because it <i>isn&#039;t</i> a slick gaming experience. Misunderstand me right, horrible UI is horrible, and would be better if improved. But the difficulty curve, the unforgivingness, is really appealing to me. <br><br>For two reasons - the first one is what I believe is the reason it <i>is </i>in DF, in-game narrative. Mistakes are stories. Losing that one goblin somewhere in your fortress, and have him trash a lever or whatever which in turn floods everything, is a story. It&#039;s punishing a mistake, and according to the &quot;slick gameplay&quot; philosophy shouldn&#039;t be there, but if it wasn&#039;t there wouldn&#039;t be a story. <br><br>The second reason is the sense of world it creates. A &quot;don&#039;t punish mistakes&quot;-game world is a show put up for the player. It might be a <i>good </i>show put up for the player, and some games <i>should</i> be like that, but it will make you feel like the world is an illusion only for your eyes. An unforgiving world, like that of DF, has much more of a sense of existence of its own. It&#039;s &quot;Welcome, fool, let&#039;s see how you can handle this world.&quot; There are rules, and interactions, and the game doesn&#039;t care about what might be better for the player, much like our world doesn&#039;t care about what we would prefer. Gravity will do its thing, even if you, the &quot;player&quot;, makes the mistake of stepping off a cliff. DF giant alligators will destroy doors, even if it floods the player&#039;s fortress. Rain World rocks will hurt creatures, even if you might not want to or might have made a mistake. <br><br>A world like that feels like it exists, it&#039;s not just a show for the player&#039;s enjoyment.<br><br>RW is a little bit in between, I guess. It&#039;s very good that you brought this up, because it forces me to think more about it. Is RW a play for the player, or a pre-existing world that the player is allowed entrance to? I have actually battled many design choices directly related to this, most notably the linear/open world decision, where I went with the open world. Still there are a lot of show going on, such as whenever you enter a room in that open world there just <i>happens </i>to be a lonely fly that&#039;s on its way to the closest swarming area, for your conviniece to follow. Maybe I should abolish those things as well, go all the way to the &quot;simulated world that you&#039;re allowed in&quot;? Or maybe I should drift more towards the middle?&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231042030im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/huh.gif" alt="Huh?" border="0"> One thing I&#039;m pretty sure of though, is that in RW, if you throw a rock at a creature, that creature is hurt whether you want it or not...<br><br><b>Update 204</b><br>Making lizards see pups was surprisingly easy. I contemplated making a custom-tailored solution for pups in the lizards AI, but I&#039;m happy I didn&#039;t. Instead I created a &quot;pupsAndPlayersGlobalList&quot; which has all pups <i>and </i>all players in it, then did an automatic replace everywhere in the lizards AI code changing &quot;playersList&quot; for the new one. Voil√°, the lizard booted &quot;brain ghosts&quot; for all of the pups, spotted them, kept track of them, hunted them, and even carried them back to their dens more or less flawlessly. <br><br>One intersting feature is that a player can tug at one end of a pup while a lizard pulls the other. I think I&#039;ll keep it, with some adjustments, it has some really intense visual/emotional qualities to it. <br>

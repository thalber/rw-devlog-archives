James, what do you mean you&#039;re biased?<br><br>One of the main influences to Rain World&#039;s aesthetic has always been graffiti, believe it or not. In a way the game is set in a graffiti drawing, or in a graffiti world. It&#039;s the same kind of urban, abandoned areas, and if you take a look at the &quot;plants&quot; they&#039;re rather graffitti ornaments than plants as we know them. The lizards are very inspired by this aesthetic.<br><br>My other main source of inspiration is, once again believe it or not, early 20&#039;th century cartoons, like this stuff:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141227105819im_/http://www.uwishunu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/steamboat-willie.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br><br>This aestethic is visible in for example the look of the player character, and the choice to keep most levels almost colorless.<br><br>There are quite a few things that others have expressed to me that they&#039;ve felt when they&#039;ve looked at the material that wasn&#039;t really intended by me. I never intended for RW to be artsy, for example, I view it very much as a work of pop art rather than <i>art</i>. It&#039;s a cartoon rather than a french film. It&#039;s hip hop or electronica rather than a sonnet. I think pop culture can carry as much emotional/intellectual content as fine art, and I think pop culture is more fitting for a game (which, besides of conveying emotion, also should be <i>fun</i>), which is why I went with the pop culture path for this project. <br><br>Another one is that RW is dark and grim. This wasn&#039;t really my intention either. I wanted to create a sense of abandonment, and part of that was having these creatures live their lifes without any society or supervision. They&#039;re just trying to survive, and from that comes the behaviours of eating each other and trying to defend themselves. The game contains no sadism, no sexual violence, no torture, just the struggle for survival. It&#039;s not more &quot;darkgrim&quot; than nature is - I&#039;ve never deliberately added any dark tones.<br><br>Of these:<br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141227105819/http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.msg944078#msg944078">Quote from: jamesprimate on September 12, 2013, 10:52:02 AM</a></div><div class="quote">&quot;cute&quot; &quot;alien&#039; &quot;mysterious&quot;<br></div>Cute was pretty much a by-effect of having a cartoon character as the protagonist. Also cute is in a way necessary for a good game protagonist, I believe, as it is also &quot;relatable&quot;. A cute face is something we tend to project ourselves onto, while an ugly face we tend to objectify and think of as &quot;the other&quot;. Alien is good, in the sense &quot;otherwordly&quot; - it <i>is </i>another world: Rain World. Mysterious is good, but I&#039;m going for a certain flavour of it. I want modern mystery, not ancient mystery. Not an old forest, but that time you wandered off and ended up behind an old power station where no-one had set foot for at least 20 years and crows had been living their crow lifes without even understanding what a power station is. Urban mystery, perhaps.<br><br>Thus, this:<br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141227105819/http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.msg943933#msg943933">Quote from: Rabbit on September 12, 2013, 05:23:15 AM</a></div><div class="quote">like a cartoon belly button.<br></div>is intentional and intended.

Still, I don&#039;t want it to be <i>goofy</i>, it shouldn&#039;t feel like Dora the explorer or whatever. <br><br>I guess what I like about graffiti is the contrast. It&#039;s loud, whacky, colorful and cartoony, but where the goofy voices stop there&#039;s an echo, a vast sense of abandonment. Because where all this whackyness takes place is some kind of no longer used industrial area, and at the feet of the cartoon character a little spruce is growing, year by year, and a plastic bag is slowly decomposing. Nature is cold and lonely, but never as cold and lonely as when compared to the meaningless chatter of our culture. There&#039;s no feeling of abandonment and godlessness as when you see pop culture next to a spruce growing, and understand that whatever we say and do, the universe doesn&#039;t even care.<br><br>I want to convey this, preferably within an area of 1024*768 pixels and with... typography. So I&#039;m in for a challenge. <br><br>Sorry about today&#039;s post being a little different, I usually talk about <i>what </i>I do not as much as <i>why </i>I&#039;m doing it when it comes to art. At the end of the day I believe these concepts can not properly be conveyed with words, which is why we have art to carry them. If everything could be written, why would we paint?<br><br>Still, it might have given insight into why this is a difficult hurdle and not something I&#039;ve just slapped together already.

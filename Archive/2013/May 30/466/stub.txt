It&#039;d make a cute loading icon!<br></div><br>Excellent idea lad!<br></div>At this point there&#039;s no loading time longer than one or two seconds, so hopefully that won&#039;t be necessary.<br><br><b>Update 147</b><br>I&#039;ve been doing a lot of work, but it hasn&#039;t been the interesting kind of work, which is why I haven&#039;t been posting. For example I re-wrote the code for how lizards behave in relation to eggs, so now it&#039;s more or less working again. I also moved one of the filters that&#039;s applied to the levels - earlier it was applied when saving the level, now it&#039;s applied when tha game loads it. It adds a few fractions of a second to the loading times, but it cuts the size of the level files in half.<br><br>Other than that I&#039;ve been doing a little bit of level design, for the tutorial levels actually:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141219052736im_/http://oi42.tinypic.com/al1ao9.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br><br>There will be three of them, and they&#039;ll teach you how to run, crawl, jump and climb. When you&#039;re finished with them you&#039;ll enter the hub world, and won&#039;t be able to return.<br><br>Apart from all this I&#039;ve started to modify the level editor in order to support a big change - a function that will render <i>all </i>the levels in one long go. The process will probably be several hours, but I hope that it&#039;ll be able to do it in the background while I use the computer for other stuff. What I&#039;ve gotten done so far is: 1, the level editor is now able to render a level without showing it on the screen, speeding up the process somewhat. 2, the level editor now saves and loads the light mask. Earlier you had to re-draw what parts of the level you wanted to be lit and what parts should be in shadow every time you wanted to render it. Being able to render a large number of levels with the press of one button will make the creation and modification of bigger chunks of the hub world much more effective.<br><br>Edit: The mass renderer is up and running! I can select an entire list of levels and it works its way through them. I figure it&#039;s torture to the processor and RAM, but it&#039;s possible to do other stuff (such as writing this) while it&#039;s rendering. It&#039;s always an awesome feeling when you get a powerful dev tool working.<br><br>Edit edit: Aaaaand there&#039;s a bug. -.- Gotta track it down.

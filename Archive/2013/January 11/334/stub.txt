Thank you! The prototype isn&#039;t available anymore, because I&#039;m not too proud of it when looking at it in the light of today&#039;s progress.<br><br>The day after tomorrow I&#039;ll be leaving for Africa! From there on I know nothing at all, except that I expect to be back 12 weeks later. <br><br>This may be a backside of game making as a hobby - Rain World is not my job, and it has to adapt to my life rather than the other way around. Still, the game is fueled by my inspiration, and only staying in my room coding doesn&#039;t give me any of that. So in that way, what&#039;s good for me is good for Rain World.<br><br>Thank you all for your interest and your help. Don&#039;t worry about the game, I&#039;ve put way too much time into it to not complete it. I&#039;ll be back in shorter than you expect, and I will bring with me new inspiration and renewed energy.<br><br>See you in a bit!

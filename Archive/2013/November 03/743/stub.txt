Haha James, you&#039;re able to sell this game in a way I&#039;ll never will be&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141230111424im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/grin.gif" alt="Grin" border="0"> But seriously, if you want a walking sound, you have to play it at each footstep, right?<br><br><b>Update 192</b><br>Adding new art assets...<br><br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141230111424/http://oi44.tinypic.com/33z8u3o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141230111424im_/http://oi44.tinypic.com/33z8u3o.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" border="0"></a><br><span style="font-size: 6pt; line-height: 1.3em;">(click for full size)</span><br><br>There are many new tiles etc, some of them can be seen in this image. See the metal spheres out on the left? Those utilize a new feature I&#039;ve implemented for tiles, I call it vertical/horizontal displacement. To minimize confusion, let&#039;s talk about the vertical one. I have a tile that&#039;s repeatable. I chop it at some random height, and switch the parts. If I base the randomness of that chop height on the horizontal placement of the tile, all tiles that are in the same column will be chopped at the same place, and line up with each other. That way they will all be &quot;scrolled&quot; a random tile height up or down. I developed this for chains - now I can put several chains next to each other without them lining up perfectly.<br><br>Also I added a new framework for plant life. The thing in the screenshot I call &quot;sprawlbush&quot;, and is the only implementation of that framework I have at this point. It basically creates branches and move them around at random in the 3D space, avoiding to collide with walls. If you look at how the leftmost plant has grown, you might notice that it has tried to avoid the airconditioner box or whatever it is. Previously I didn&#039;t have any plants that grew in the z-axis, and I think that these new plants have potential to look interesting with shadows - I&#039;ll do a little experimentation.<br><br>When moving in the Z axis the plants can never cross Z layer 5, because that&#039;s where the game is played. If a branch crossed layer 5 the player could pass through it, and it would look like it was cut off from the rest of the plant. Because of this these new plants are confined to either layers 0-5 or 6-29.

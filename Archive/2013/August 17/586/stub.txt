Thank you all for flattering me with questions! <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141225164313im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0"><br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141225164313/http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.msg932883#msg932883">Quote from: rundown on August 17, 2013, 01:25:40 PM</a></div><div class="quote">looks like you can do everything in this game o.O<br></div>Well, that&#039;s actually one of my goals, in a way... Don&#039;t get me wrong, the game is not at all a &quot;Spore&quot; kind of thing where the goal is that you should be able to do <i>everything</i>. Rather the game has an extremely narrow scope - there are only three types of creatures and a rock and a spear for weaponry - but I&#039;ve tried to make the interactions between those few objects as fleshed out as possible. So you can&#039;t do everything, because there are very few things, but you can do quite a lot with those few things.<br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141225164313/http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.msg932911#msg932911">Quote from: Mr. LL on August 17, 2013, 02:00:25 PM</a></div><div class="quote">Are spears a limited resource? Do they wear out?<br></div>Yes, and no. They are a limited resource - in custom mode there&#039;s usually only one per level that the players have to fight over, and in world mode they are even more precious as you will have to take a detour in order to get one. They don&#039;t wear out, but are still spent in a way. When you hit a lizard the spear is lodged in the lizard, and in order to retrieve it you&#039;ll have to get close to the lizard, which is extremely dangerous. If you hit a wall there&#039;s a risk it might get stuck. So basically, when you throw a spear there&#039;s no guarantee that you&#039;ll get it back.<br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141225164313/http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.msg933029#msg933029">Quote from: yosh on August 17, 2013, 07:55:48 PM</a></div><div class="quote">Do you have any kind of procedurally generated textures / shapes?

Track a few pages back here, and you&#039;ll see a little more about how I&#039;ve animated stuff.<br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141225164313/http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.msg933035#msg933035">Quote from: 7heSama on August 17, 2013, 08:16:12 PM</a></div><div class="quote">Can you only pin them to walls, not floors/ceilings? <br></div>You only throw left or right, not up and down.

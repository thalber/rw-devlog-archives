<b>Update 160</b><br>I felt like doing something fun today, so I implemented sticking creatures to walls with spears. In the gif I pull the lizard into position with the mouse. The movement is jerky and the lizard looks chopped up, but needless to say there won&#039;t be any such behaviour&nbsp; in the final game. It&#039;s just a convinient dev tool to be able to instantly move creatures around like that.<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141223032111im_/http://oi42.tinypic.com/1r27om.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br>(When I look at this thing now I realize how horribly brutal it is&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141223032111im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/shocked.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0"> I don&#039;t exactly think of it that way, because to me it&#039;s all numbers and testing functionality. Don&#039;t worry though, the game won&#039;t play like this. It&#039;s not about cold-bloodedly placing helpless creatures in position for butchering - actually the real thing will rather have you at a disadvantage to the enemy.)<br><br>In the actual game there are very few situations where this happens, as it&#039;s not often a lizard is climbing next to a wall. But I like to have neat little details like this, even if they occur rarely. It gives the game another dimension of depth.<br><br>The spears can be wiggeled out, if the body they are stuck in moves around a lot. That means that a living lizard will sooner or later get free, and that a dead one can fall down if you jump on it/mess around with it enough.

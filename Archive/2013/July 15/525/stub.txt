Thank you all for your support! I can&#039;t believe how excited everyone seems :O Just remember: High hopes, low expectations...<br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141219052730/http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.msg915979#msg915979">Quote from: Skomakar&#039;n on July 12, 2013, 06:55:09 AM</a></div><div class="quote">Välkommen hem, käre landsman.<br></div>Tack, landsman! :D<br><br>When it comes to porting, the problem is that I&#039;m using Macromedia Director, and in order to do things such as changing the screen resolution or recieveing gamepad input I use add-ons. While I could compile a Mac version (which I think would lag, because that&#039;s my experience with Director executables for mac) I wouldn&#039;t have the add-ons, so the game wouldn&#039;t be able to do a lot of important stuff. Sadly I think this problem would persist if you try to run it through some kind of windows emulator or whatever. Maybe someone here is a Macromedia Director / Mac guru, and can help me sort it out? <br><br>On the subject of operative systems, I just tried the game on windows 8, and it seems to work. That&#039;s good news. It&#039;s lagging horribly on my notebook though, but as long as it&#039;s running at all I&#039;m decently happy. Would&#039;ve been a shame if the thing was already outdated at release. Game pad works too, but needs some tweaking.<br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141219052730/http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.msg916166#msg916166">Quote from: Zaphos on July 12, 2013, 02:05:12 PM</a></div><div class="quote">Are you planning to release it in some form anyway?&nbsp; I hope so ...<br></div>Yes, I do plan to release it. It will be free to download and share, possibly with a paypal account where you can donate something small if you&#039;re in that kind of mood.<br><br>As a lot of people seem to be interested in the technical aspect of the game, I&#039;ll try to find time to write something up on that. The basic idea is very simple though: While a game character normally consists of one box that can collide with terrain, the RW character consists of <i>two </i>boxes. So, instead of having a character that&#039;s always head up feet down, we have a character that consists of an upper body and a lower body, and they are moving around independently but at a fixed distance.

James, maybe you could take a look in your archives to see if you have anything suiting for a tounge shooting out? Or for a lump of mucus hitting a wall? For the latter I&#039;ve been using your &quot;egg splat&quot; samples, they work wonderfully but have a bit too much echo perhaps.<br><br>Also, what do you think we should do about single player? Add more spears and make it more of an action game?&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141225164313im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/huh.gif" alt="Huh?" border="0">

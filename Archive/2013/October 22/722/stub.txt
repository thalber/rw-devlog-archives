Thank you&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229074531im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0"> As for website, idk... This is not a commercial game, it&#039;s just a hobby project. Even if it has been taken one level further by James convincing me to submit to IGF. The question is, would you really prefer for me to spend time on making a website, rather than making the game?<br><br><b>Update 188</b><br>I&#039;ve been taking a few days off from Rain World after the big IGF work rush. Today I picked it up again. The game feels much nicer with finished menues everywhere! But some of the typography still looks pretty awful. For now I&#039;m focusing on the functionality, and then I can return to the graphical specifics later.<br><br>This is the match over screen I&#039;ve been talking about, now programmed and functioning, not just mocked-up:<br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229074531/http://oi44.tinypic.com/w14i3c.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229074531im_/http://oi44.tinypic.com/w14i3c.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" border="0"></a><br>(Click for full size)<br><br>And this is what I did today, <br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229074531/http://oi42.tinypic.com/1y4b6e.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229074531im_/http://oi42.tinypic.com/1y4b6e.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" border="0"></a><br>a special game over screen for waves mode that lists all the lizards you&#039;ve killed. The little crosses even appear one by one (quickly) with one of James&#039; sounds accompanying them. Pretty awesome!<br><br>Both of these end game screens can scale up and down to accommodate different amounts of crosses/players, and move up and down accordingly so they appear in a spot that&#039;s easy on the eyes. The match over screen can display different outcomes such as draws, doesn&#039;t say &quot;Winner!&quot; if there&#039;s only one player, etc etc.<br><br>And yeah, the menues change color to match the level they&#039;re on. Thought that would be a nice little detail <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229074531im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0">

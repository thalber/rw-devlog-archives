<b>Update 135</b><br>Dear readers, I&#039;m happy to say that single player is <i><b>up and running!</b></i><br>You go out into the world, follow the flies to where they&#039;re swarming, catch as many as are required, and then head back to your den. If you have enough flies, you&#039;re brought back to the &quot;den&quot; screen, and the game is saved. From here you can either get started on the next hunt, or you can quit the game. The next time you load it your progression will be saved.<br><br>What I did today was mainly to connect huge building blocks that were all done - saving was done, swarming of different rooms was done and so on. But today I could really see the flow of the game for the first time. Still haven&#039;t really <i>played </i>it though, so I can just imagine all the tweaking it&#039;s going to need.<br><br>Aside from that I also sorted out a few quirks and gave some things cleaner solutions. For example, if the requirement for this hunt is to catch 5 flies, and you enter the den with four flies in your stomach and one in your <i>hand</i>, it still lets you in. That kind of stuff.<br><br>Oh, and items your bring into your den at the end of a hunt will reappear on the ground outside the den the next time you start playing. I think this will be neat in co-op, you&#039;ll be able to collect a little &quot;armory&quot; outside your den and run through it to collect some weapons before heading out into the world.

<b>Update 131</b><br>And I finally connected the World game mode to the new menu as well, and started outlining the framework for continuing a game from a saved file. Also when running around in the single player world a bit for the first time in ages, I found a bug where a spear would re-appear if you lodged it in a lizard and that lizard then fell off a cliff. It was easy enough to resolve, the problem was because the lizards are created earlier than the spears. First the lizard object is created, and asks &quot;is a lizard with my ID reported wounded/missing/dead in world memory?&quot;, and when it finds itself it deletes itself from world memory, as it is now loaded on the actual level. Then the spear would be created, and ask &quot;is there any lizard in world memory reported to have me stuck in it?&quot;, and the answer would be no, as the lizard had deleted itself. So, the spear would appear on the level. The problem was solved basically by changing the creation processes so that the spears are created first, stay tuned for the bugs that will arise from moving the chunks of code around.

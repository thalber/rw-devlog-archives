Started experimenting with giving the four players small, small differences. See if you can spot them!<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141219052733im_/http://oi39.tinypic.com/9scu1z.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141219052733/http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.msg889400#msg889400">Quote from: jamesprimate on May 14, 2013, 05:46:56 PM</a></div><div class="quote">hahah I&#039;ve always thought it was a mouth too XD<br><br>maybe the eyes are what is making it seem a bit cutesy. in the sprite version the eyes look so EMPTY, like &quot;I&#039;ve seen some shit&quot;.<br></div>Lol!&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141219052733im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/cheesy.gif" alt="Cheesy" border="0"><br>Yeah, wanna get to that empty stare...<br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141219052733/http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.msg889407#msg889407">Quote from: 7heSama on May 14, 2013, 06:09:09 PM</a></div><div class="quote">Somehow, I have never seen this project until now. I just read through the first 18 pages + the last few, and I&#039;m feeling a little blown away. <br><br>The effects look great, from the hanging chains and wires to the light bloom that you have in some pics. Gameplay of course looks amazing as everyone has pointed out, I love how the animation blends into the actual mechanics, which look very fun in their own right. <br><br>I think the decision to go with a hub world won&#039;t have as many downsides as you predict (or at least, predicted). Maybe the time of day and such won&#039;t be able to change, but by manipulating the tile set you can still get a feeling of progression - one area is more or less stony/industrialized/etc. <br><br>Also, I tried the runnMaze2 demo, but it seemed kind of glitchy. I couldn&#039;t figure out how to jump with either player (tried all the usual candidates), and with the brown character, movement was mapped to ESDF instead of WASD, which - if intentional - seems very, very unwise. <br><br>On a final side note, it turns out a game I&#039;ve been working on for the past month-ish is very similar to this, with the notable exception that yours is far better. :/ Oh well, I guess it will give me some ideas on how to make my game, ie, avoiding the stuff you&#039;re already doing - I don&#039;t want to make a total ripoff. <br><br>edit: Jump is K/Q? Why... <br></div><br>Sorry about the unconventional choice of keys... When I made that thing I was too lazy to look up the key codes for stuff like shift and control, so I mapped all the controls to letter keys instead <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141219052733im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/tongue.gif" alt="Tongue" border="0"> The actual game has customizable controls.<br><br>I know that the game is feeling a little bit hacky, and that&#039;s sadly just the consequence of me not being the best programmer and my software being old and limited. This game will be far from perfect, but I hope people will be able to look past the sometimes amateurish execution and appreciate the things I have accomplished and am proud of. To me just making a game is an accomplishment in itself, be it with glitches and hacks.<br><br>On the hub world stuff I&#039;ve solved it in a strange way - there&#039;s an area in the middle of the map that&#039;s underground. Around it are different areas, with different sun/weather conditions. You can&#039;t pass from one area to another without passing through the underground area. That way different times of day/weather conditions can exist, but you never have the super-obvious thing where you go from one screen to the next and the weather changes, as the underground always works as a buffer. It&#039;s a stretch, I know, but I have high expectations on my audience&#039;s willing supspencion of disbelief <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141219052733im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0"><br><br>I wish you the best of luck on your project, and am much looking forward to seeing what you&#039;re up to.

When it comes to the body language of lizards, I too would like for it to be subtle like that, and believe me, I&#039;m the first one to get involved in tiny little details! However we&#039;re talking about very small sprites here, and when a player is moving around they&#039;re not currently looking at the lizards, but at their own avatar. I had to make what&#039;s going on in the lizards&#039; heads more loud and obvious, why I added the particle effect. That said, a lizard that hears a sound will change the angle of its head and freeze for a moment before setting off to investigate.

Hehe thank you James!&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141223032125im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0"> <br><br>There&#039;s another argument against the &quot;pay whatever you want&quot; idea though - it requires people to have paypal or something. For me, the first objective is very clear: I want people to play my game. If I can collect some change in the process that&#039;s fine, money is fun. It&#039;s just that I don&#039;t think it&#039;s worth it if there are people out there who go &quot;oh, you have to have a paypal account... nevermind then&quot;. I know I would. In that case I get neither money nor a player :/ It all comes down to the golden rule, I think. Do I like it when people charge me for their games? No. Or actually, I feel completely indifferent about it, because I won&#039;t even play the game. I haven&#039;t payed for (or illegaly downloaded) a game in something like five years - the few hours of playing games I&#039;ve had during those years are all from the ever depleting pool of &quot;download for free indie&quot; games. <br><br>And on top of this I don&#039;t even know if it&#039;s <i>possible </i>to legally purchase the software I&#039;m developing this on any more.<br><br>And And I have no idea about how to implement some kind of copy protection, neither am I very interested in it as I view that kind of programming as counter-productive. Who wants to sit down for 36 hours and code a device that keeps people from enjoyment?<br><br>What it all comes down to is that if I use myself as a template for my audience, paying makes the entire difference between actually playing the game and not playing it. Put that next to my priority list - players over money - and the outcome seems clear.<br><br>That&#039;s my logic, at least. I don&#039;t know if it makes sense to anyone else?<br><br><b>Update 141</b><br>More menu stuff. Made the game smarter in some regards - for example now it doesn&#039;t keep an entire world map in memory while playing a custom game, and it doesn&#039;t keep a custom game handler in memory when playing the campaign. <br><br>Also the pause menu is now working properly, and I have the framework for a game over menu. Oh, and the game now supports game pad for the menu, if player 1 is set to game pad. Basically the menu can always be controlled by arrow keys and space/enter, but it can also be controlled by whatever input player 1 has set up.<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141223032125im_/http://oi39.tinypic.com/314bk20.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Noticed a bug where when a croc picks up a spear the spear will be displayed above both its upper and lower jaw, making it look like it&#039;s just kind of... glued to the side of its head. The correct way for this to be is that the spear should be above the lower jaw but behind the upper jaw, making it look like the lizard is pinching it in its mouth. This has to do with me changing the spawn order of lizards and spears a while back, so I&#039;ll just have to go take a look at that.

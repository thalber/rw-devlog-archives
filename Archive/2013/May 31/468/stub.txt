Hehe! Got it to work <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141219052736im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/tongue.gif" alt="Tongue" border="0"><br><br>Another interesting thing that happened yesterday was that an extension I used <i>suddenly </i>became aware that it&#039;s actually a trial version, out of nowhere. And for the trial version I&#039;m only allowed to use two functions, so I was robbed of the cryptation function I&#039;d been using for the save games.<br><br>However, I used my brain and decided that I was perfectly able to understand how basic string cryptation works, and wrote the functions myself. Basically, I convert each character to its ASCII number, and add to that number the corresponding character in the key string. The decryptation works the same way, but with subtraction. <br><br>I&#039;m pretty sure there&#039;s a way to decrypt this, especially if the key is short enough to see it repeat, but honestly, if you&#039;re gonna go through that trouble you&#039;re welcome to mess with your save file. The only thing I want is for it not to be <i>too </i>tempting to just open up the save and give yourself 10 000 spears.

It&#039;s mostly running well enough, in some of the more extreme situations I can notice some slowdown on my machine. I think most people will be able to enjoy the game perfectly well <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150101012640im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0"><br><br><b>Update 215</b><br>It&#039;s been kind of quiet here, with the holidays and all - I hope to get back on track soon enough. Also James has been setting up the kickstarter, and I&#039;ve been assisting him some in that. James said it might be a good idea to do a count down to opening the kickstarter, in order to get people hyped, so here we go:<br><br><i><b>THREE DAYS TO KICKSTARTING RAIN WORLD!</b></i><br><br>In other news, I&#039;ve added the feature of jumping on other creatures. Preciously you could collide with other creatures, but not jump on them. Now, if you press the jump button while colliding with another creature and not being like, below it, you can jump on it. The jump will propel you upwards, while the other creature is inflicted with an equal force downwards, and in the case of lizard a tiny 3 frame stun. For lizards the downwards force is also boosted a little bit compared to what the mass of the two creatures would suggest (screw conservation of energy) to make up for the fact that they&#039;re most often fairly steadily anchored to whatever they&#039;re clinging to, and you didn&#039;t see much effect otherwise.<br><br>Jumping on a creature gives that creature your kill tag, but only if no other player has a kill tag on it already. This means that you can (<i>in theory</i>) get a kill on a lizard by jumping on it and making it fall to the bottom of the level, but only if no other player has recently damaged it. This is because it would feel kind of cheap if you speared a lizard and it&#039;s just lying there, not quite dead yet, and then your friend comes by and nudges it with his feet and that makes the kill count as his.<br><br>EDIT: Some answers to questions, sorry guys:<br>@DarkWanderer - the game can either be finished with a fairly small map, or, if the kickstarter goes well, be expanded to proper metroidvania size. We&#039;ll see what happens <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150101012640im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0"><br>@NicoM - get ready to laugh... Macromedia Director. It was the only platform I was comfortable with when I started two years ago, and this was just going to be a month long project or so anyways... There isn&#039;t exactly a demo for this current game, but there is a movement prototype from when only the player character was made, in which you can move around a little and get a feel for the controls. Someone re-uploaded it a few pages back, if you do a little digging and searching you&#039;ll find it.

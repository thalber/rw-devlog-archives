Whoops, there&#039;s obviously a little delay on getting projects started for them to review the project, so we can&#039;t launch until the 7&#039;th. Sorry!<br><i><b>ONE WEEK TILL KICKSTARTING RAIN WORLD</b></i><br><br>and yeah, we have been trying to make the game look appealing to newcomers as well!<br>Happy New Year everybody!

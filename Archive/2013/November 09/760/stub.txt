@Slader, yeah they can certainly starve - that&#039;s the main problem. I think they will also have a bit of different personalities among the three of them (and slightly different colors to set them apart). One thing I have planned that might be interesting is that one of them is extra bad. Either it&#039;s just not very good at surviving, or it has a wounded leg or something. That would really put you in some difficult moral dilemmas. <br><br>@Artemi, I think that as the game is now, trying to stay alive yourself is plenty enough reason <i>not </i>to save the pups. The game is haaaaaard. You don&#039;t at all need any extra handicap, even without worrying about anyone but myself even I have trouble in single player, and I don&#039;t even want to think about what it has to be like for a beginner.<br><br>@Christian, damn, stop pleading to pay me money... The temptation... Actually I&#039;m in a pretty bad place economically right now, but hopefully that won&#039;t affect rain world too much. It does however affect how sensitive I am to temptation like that... <br><br>I want the game to be free because I remember being in my lower teens, and loving little downloadable games, and exclusively playing ones that were free. I liked it when they were free. It&#039;s another kind of atmosphere around a game that&#039;s free. <br><br>Also, if I charge people, there are expectations to meet. Fact is, I have no idea how I would put together a mac build, I have a super low-fi 2D game that runs super slow on any PC that is not very powerful, etc etc. That stuff won&#039;t fly if I charge people.<br><br>What I could do, is I could take donations. I could do it through kickstarter, perhaps. I work as a freelance graphic designer, and one idea is that people who are enthusiastic about rain world could donate some money, and effectively buy hours from me. So, I work on the game like I normally do, but if people put in some money I can work some extra, because I don&#039;t have to work on my actual work. Would anyone be interested in anything like that?<br><br>Drop a post if you&#039;d donate something small.<br><br><b>Update 198</b><br>Started on (and almost finished)the first milestone in the AI of the pups - the terrain mapping. That&#039;s basically an algorithm that goes through the level and marks tiles as walkable, creates connections between them etc. For example, you might see little red arrows at the ledges. Those are &quot;ledge drop connection&quot;, that flag that from this tile you can drop down to the floor below.<br><br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141230111513/http://oi44.tinypic.com/30u8m5x.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141230111513im_/http://oi44.tinypic.com/30u8m5x.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" border="0"></a><br><br>There are other connections except from ledge drops, there are jump-and-grab, short cuts, etc. They are sorted into incoming and outgoing categories. So, for example, a tile from which you can drop to the floor below has an outgoing ledge drop connection. The tile below has an incoming ledge drop connection.<br><br>This is because the A* path finding will work backwards, from the goal to the start. That works better for some scenarios, because then you can abandon a path finding session part-through, and keep all the direction flags in the tiles. This means that a creature that doesn&#039;t have a fresh path will follow an old trace in the level, meaning that it will be headed to wherever it was headed last time it passed by those specific tiles. The alternative would be that creatures without fresh paths would head towards <i>where they were standing last time the path finding algorithm passed over these tiles</i> which makes less sense. Not a big problem though, as most of the times they have decently fresh path to follow.<br><br>So, the path finding fill will start at the goal, and crawl outward looking for connections. Maybe it crawls across a floor, and comes across an <i>incoming </i>ledge drop connection. This means that you can drop to this tile from above. Then it goes to the ledge that connection refers to, and continues to crawl from there. Then, perhaps, it runs into the creature pathing - and the path is finished. The pathing creature will now follow the path, to the ledge, find the ledge drop connection, jump down, and proceed to the goal.<br><br>Basically it will work like the lizards already do, but simpler since I don&#039;t have the horror of not being able to turn around in a corridor to worry about.

<b>Update 134</b><br>When messing with save files some new problems emerged, because of some special cases that didn&#039;t occur if you just played a fresh world every time. So I rewrote the code that loads lizards from memory, in order to be able to be more selective about what to save and how when I save a lizard. This way I can for example save the health of a lizard but ignore it&#039;s position. It comes in handy when you end a hunt in world mode and want the lizards to have crawled back into their holes, but their injuries to be intact.<br><br>The current system supports the following scenarios:<br><br>Lizard has not spawned yet<br>Lizard has spawned offscreen, and should be generated out somewhere in the level<br>Lizard is saved as alive, and should be recreated close to where it was last seen<br>Lizard is saved as dead, and a corpse should be recreated on the same spot<br>Lizard is saved as dead and not on the screen (for example if it has fallen out of the level), and should simply not appear at all<br><br>Seems to cover it, right?<br><br>Everything&#039;s working out fine in the artificial de-bugging scenarios I&#039;ve been running, but with stuff complicated as this it&#039;s hard to know if something has escaped me. <br><br>In short, saving/loading seems to be pretty much done by now. The next big step in getting the single player campaign up and running will be the between-level screen, which should have little animations showing how many flies you&#039;ve caught and so on.

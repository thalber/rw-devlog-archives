Yeah, I&#039;m finally back in Sweden again! The reverse culture shock is kind of freaking me out &nbsp;<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141223032105im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/shocked.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0"><br><br>Thank you all for supporting me, and bothering to read this despite me only posting boring UI stuff. Believe me, I too wish this was done so I could wrap up the game world and release this thing. Not too far away though.<br><br>As a thanks, here&#039;s a .gif showing me trying to keep a couple of lizards at bay by throwing rocks at them.<br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141223032105im_/http://imgwiz.com/images/2013/09/25/dl8BP.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br><b>Update 150</b><br>Created a placeholder &quot;end of custom game&quot; screen, which seems to be working OK. Also made the level editor save, and the game load, a menu color for each level - that way the shade of the pause menu looks nice together with the overall palette of that specific level.

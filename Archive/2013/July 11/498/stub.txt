Hi Graham!<br>I&#039;d love to do a short interview, and if you need me to provide any material I&#039;ll do that too <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141223032105im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0"><br><br>However, for any press stuff, I want it to be crystal clear that this is not a cool new game in development, but a guy goofing around on his laptop and making some glitchy mess that could potentially be interesting from a theoretical perspective. <br><br>I think that what hype always does is making 75 feel like -25, because you were expecting 100. That might make sense if you&#039;re selling something and need the hype, but I&#039;m not, so I prefer to keep expectations low. However, I&#039;m always flattered when someone shows interest in the project <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141223032105im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0"><br><br>I&#039;ll shoot you an email!<br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141223032105/http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.msg915310#msg915310">Quote from: ghoulkid86 on July 11, 2013, 01:30:40 AM</a></div><div class="quote">This thing will revolutionize &quot;simple&quot; 2d game graphics for real.

I like the idea of somehow showing a little of what the world is about, but I think straight up depiction is too blunt. I&#039;ll give it a thought. You&#039;re totally right that the &quot;i&quot; is too much like a &quot;z&quot;.<br><br><b>Update 159</b><br>I&#039;m putting the logo stuff on hold - instead I&#039;ve for the first time started to seriously create the world.

Yeah, sandbox mode is gonna be fun. It&#039;ll keep track of flies caught, eggs captured, lizards killed and so on, and just present the numbers without choosing an official winner - that way you can play with/against each other towards whatever goal you agree upon. It&#039;ll allow you to play on any map against any lizards, and you&#039;ll have full control over all the settings.<br><br><b>Update 146</b><br><br>Buttons:<br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141219052733im_/http://oi42.tinypic.com/9lap2v.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br><br>And a little animation for the player:<br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141219052733im_/http://oi42.tinypic.com/2s9qatv.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br><br>This one is not going in the game, which is animated with programming, but is for the menu. The custom game screen has the four players standing at the bottom of the screen, and they can be clicked to switch between awake and sleeping to determine which players are in for the game. This is the transition animations between awake and sleeping.<br><br>In other news I moved the player colors from being hard coded in the player object to being defined in a list at startup. This means that they are now teoretically completely customizable, though I doubt I&#039;ll let people set them with RGB-parameters, liero style. Maybe you will be able to find a collectable in single player that unlocks new color choices? I don&#039;t like things like that too much as they&#039;re slightly out of canon - it&#039;s hard to tell whether they are actually supposed to be part of the world or if they&#039;re a gamey thing slapped on for the players. But it does add a little replayability.<br><br>I became a little bit tired of all the menu stuff and spent a few minutes adding a new object, a bait. Basically it&#039;s the same as a rock, except you can&#039;t throw it for damage and when it sits on the ground it attracts flies. It&#039;s funny how easy it is to add stuff like that compared to how annoying it is to just add a new button in the menu. The bait likely won&#039;t have a big role in the game at all, but maybe it&#039;ll be somewhere on the single player map just for fun.

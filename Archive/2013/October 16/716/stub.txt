Yep, we&#039;re submitting it :D<br><br><b>Update 187</b><br>Panic work rush because of IGF submission. I <i>finally</i> implemented the end of match screen, a new pause screen, and a game over screen for single player. This is stuff I&#039;ve been putting up for like, a year. No, seriously, a year is a reasonable estiamtion for when I first started to think &quot;maybe it&#039;s time to fix the end och match screen&quot;. Today I sat down and DID IT.<br><br>For all the typography I&#039;ve used what I currently have. I know it&#039;s not 100%, but I figure it&#039;s better for IGF than the placeholder stuff that I drew with my mouse in 4.2 seconds in order to know which image was which. Lol. But the technical setup I have should allow to change graphics pretty easily. <br><br>Only thing left to do is the &quot;end of multiplayer game session&quot; screen. When you play multiplayer, you select a few levels and they&#039;re added to a tier. When you finish one of them, there&#039;s an &quot;end of match&quot; screen that pops up on top of the level, that basically states who died and who survived, and how many flies each player caught. Also a match winner is nominated.<br><br>When this has happened a few times, and the tier is out of levels, the game should take you to the &quot;end of session&quot; screen, where a session winner should be nominated (the one with most matches won) and some statistics for each player should be visible. That&#039;s the thing I need to do now.<br><br>But, James says we can re-upload after the deadline, so maybe I&#039;ll do that if things get too frantic <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229074513im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0">

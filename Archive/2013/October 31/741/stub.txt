Yeah, the framerate is looow. But a trailer was needed to submit to IGF, and as James said, the guy who was supposed to make one didn&#039;t really know what we wanted to have in it, so we ended up with a trailer that had a lot of unfinished levels shown. So James decided to make one himself, but neither of our computers are able to capture video very well, so here we are. As the game is not a commercial project it doesn&#039;t really matter that the trailer isn&#039;t the smoothest thing out there, as it&#039;s purpose isn&#039;t marketing, but just being a trailer so we could enter IGF&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141230111424im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/tongue.gif" alt="Tongue" border="0"><br><br><b>Update 191</b><br>I&#039;ve been away for a little vacation, if you wonder why I haven&#039;t been posting in a few days.<br><br>Yesterday I made a thing that I hope will have a big positive influence on the game - I threw together a sound prototyper for James. The sound prototyper is a special build of the game that can load sound files from a folder and replace samples in the game with these loaded sounds. <br><br>Earlier we have been having a problem where James make sounds, and send them to me, and I implement them and try it out. Then I give James useful feedback such as &quot;It doesn&#039;t sound quite right. I don&#039;t know, just like, not quite right. Could you make it &#039;skueeeeshier&#039;?&quot; Then James would try to interpret that, make a new batch, send it to me, repeat and fade.<br><br>There is some kind of phenomena where a sound is percieved totally differently in the game than played by itself. I don&#039;t know if this is because of macromedia director&#039;s sound engine, or because of context. In either case a sound that appears to be perfectly awesome in windows media player can become lame in the game, perhaps because it doesn&#039;t sync with the animation.<br><br>Hopefully this problem is defeated now, as the sound prototyper allows James to work on the sounds and try them at the same time. The iteration process should hopefully be shortened from like two days to like two minutes. <br><br>I think this will make a big difference for the soundscape of Rain World, given that James can handle the horrible horrible user interface!

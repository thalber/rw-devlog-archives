Thanks guys!<br><br>@heinzius, yeah that contrast is what I&#039;m going for. Thank you for taking your time to create that mockup! I think you&#039;re right in that there should be some architecture to acompany it... I won&#039;t use blur though, as there&#039;s no blur anywhere else in the game. Maybe I could use some sort of drawn backdrop - I&#039;ll have to experiment.<br><br><b>Update 175</b><br>James sent me a new bach of sounds, and they&#039;re implemented! I also added a sort of gradient to the start of each sound the lizards make, so that it fades in rather than starting at full power out of nowhere. Sounds a lot better.<br><br>What I&#039;ve spent most time doing, however, is throwing the &quot;egg hunt&quot; game type out, and replacing it with a standard horde mode co-op survival thing. Egg hunt was boring, and it can be created by tweaking the settings of sand box mode. <br><br>Waves mode, as I call the new gametype, is the only one where players are cooperating. You&#039;re stuck on a level, and the lizards keep coming in waves. There&#039;s a function that creates the waves, which uses a &quot;budget&quot; that steadily increases over the waves in order to &quot;buy&quot; lizards that have different &quot;prices&quot; assigned to them depending on their difficulty. So basically it gets harder and harder with each wave.<br><br>As it stands the players get spears by catching flies. It doesn&#039;t make any sense at all, but I figured it would be fun. So there are a few flies flying around, and if you catch them they turn into spears in your hands. Other than that you have to rely on stunning lizards you&#039;ve already speared with rocks, and retrieve the spears.<br><br>The new dynamic area mapping stuff seems to work OK:<br><br>-removed image, sorry-<br><br>What I do here is that as soon as the lizards spawn I throw them out of the level to kill them, so we can see how the next lizard maps its turf. The green lizard is unable to climb, and is thus restricted to the three leftmost platforms. Note how the last lizard in the gif, a wall climber, has access to the upper right area where the platform is missing. This is because wall climbers can climb on terrain in the background layer.<br><br>At one time it lagged a little bit when 4 blue lizards wanted to map their turfs at the same time, but I can probably do something about that. If I feel ambitios I could slow it down depending on how many other dynamic mappings are being done at the same time.

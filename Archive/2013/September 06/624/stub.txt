@megaboy Certainly, sir. The very little I&#039;ve seen of your pixels I really like. What do you have in mind?<br>@Ninja Dodo yeah, that might be it... I&#039;ve managed to getting it to look a bit better. I&#039;ll check out the muppets.<br>@artemi I always hesitate to animate stuff that&#039;s not actually visible... I don&#039;t like it when games make bright sprites flow everywhere even for stuff that shouldn&#039;t look like that. Like the bees being yellow lines of glowing plasma in bioshock and stuff like that. It feels like they think you&#039;re stupid, like LOOKATIT! My game on the other hand is too far to the other side, there&#039;s a lot of guesswork, the levels are hard to read etc. So I try to keep the ugly sprites to things I posetivley <i>have </i>to have, such as items blinking when they&#039;re in range to pick up. But I could maybe make som slime particles fly out of their mouths...<br><br><b>Update 171</b><br>Made the growling look a bit better, and implemented it more completely. The lizards now react by growling to a number of situations, such as when spawning, when spotting a player, when damaged, when injured, and sometimes when bored. The system adapts the growls so that they&#039;re modyfied depending on the situation - some growls are short, some are low, some are intense and so on. Different types of lizards also have different growl patterns, which weaves into the different growls system. For example the white lizard is supposed to be the sneaky one, and as such tends to keep more quiet. The blue one, which hates taking shortcuts, will give a growl of frustration upon exiting one. The red one will mostly be quiet, but when it growls it&#039;s a big growl. Etc etc.<br><br>A positive development is that the growling seems to have made the game a little easier. For two reasons. It occupies the lizards a little bit, they move slower when growling. Previously they meant business, they would just hunt you like cold killers. Now they sometimes stop to express some emotion, which might give you a split second to jump out of the way. The other reason is the factor of communication - this seems to have improved it as a game in general. The growling makes you more aware of what&#039;s going on in their heads and where they are on the level. When they spawn they make a sound. When they spot you they make a sound. This seems to somewhat increase the player&#039;s understanding on what&#039;s going on, which decreases fake difficulty. Now you more often tend to die because you messed up, not because you didn&#039;t have enough information about what lizard were where and doing what.<br><br>Don&#039;t be alarmed though - you still die <i>a lot</i>.

@Artemi, yeah, I think there should be a very violent but muted sound when you&#039;re sleeping. There should be a door, which I guess should go into the same category as all the other architecture - it&#039;s built by unknown creatures that aren&#039;t present any more (it&#039;s obviously not the bear creatures, as they are not capable of language. Which I imagine is a must in order to build this kind of stuff). I won&#039;t make it a cutscene though, I&#039;ll keep the door in-game. Oh, and don&#039;t worry about posting, I&#039;m just happy to be reminded that people read this <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141227105755im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0"><br>@James thanks! I&#039;ll send you a build asap so you can try it out. Also, do you have anything in mind for the above mentioned rain pounding on the suface above sound? Maybe the same as the current rain sound but with the discant cut out? And thanks for teaching me the word &quot;regurgitation&quot;. That&#039;s what I needed in my life.<br><br>Take a look at the save room. The central chamber is the shelter. To the sides of it you can see the slots where the doors will go. The tanks outside I plan to give an animation where they fill up with extremely high-pressure, turbulent water, in order to give a sense of the intensity of the rain outside. That stuff should probably have a sound as well...<br><br><b>Update 170</b><br>This morning I recieved some sweet lizard growls from James, which I&#039;ve been fighting to implement. It has been troublesome though, for some reason I&#039;m not able to make the magic happen. It&#039;s like, you see the lizard open its mouth, and you hear the sound, but it doesn&#039;t feel like the lizard is emitting it. I don&#039;t quite know what to do about this.<br><br>One idea I had was to open the sounds in some software that draws them as graphs. Then I could screenshot those graphs and put them into the game, and make the lizards read the graph as they&#039;re growling. Then I could map the openness of the jaw to the latitude on the graph, and hopefully have it look more coordinated. That&#039;s a huge big thing to do though, which might or might not solve the problem and which has many opportunities to go wrong. Hm... I&#039;ll keep thinking.

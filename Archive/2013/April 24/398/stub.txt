<b>@Wolfbane </b><br>Hey thanks! I really like your stuff. However, I already have a music/sound artist on board, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141225164351/http://jamesprimate.tk/" target="_blank">James Primate</a>, who has made no less than 15 (!) awesome tracks for me as well as some sound effects. So we don&#039;t really <i>need </i>any more music. But you could always contact James, he&#039;s the one in charge of the music and maybe he has some ideas. He&#039;s on these forums.

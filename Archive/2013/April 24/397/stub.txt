Man, never until I had one did I realize how <b>full</b>time a fulltime job is... It like... fills up your entire time.<br><br><b>Update 138</b><br>Today I worked some on the menu layout to have it make more sense. The most complicated menu screen is no doubt the Custom Game screen, so I started with that hoping that everything else would feel easy afterwards. Now I have the layout:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141225164351im_/http://oi36.tinypic.com/35irneh.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br><br>and also the functionality, so it&#039;s just a question of applying one on the other. And draw the actual icons and stuff, of course. These symbols are place holder.<br><br>The big squiggle will be the game type title, similar in style to the game&#039;s title screen. The arrows on the sides cycle through the game types. Between the two lines are the game type options, complete with level tier. The four little ellipses represent the players, you click them to toggle their participation in the game (four player mode is something I&#039;m hoping to do, but I&#039;ve not actually tried it so I&#039;ll have to see how the engine is able to handle it). Here I&#039;ll use the in-game sprites, they&#039;ll animate between the standard standing animation and a sleeping animation. Other than that there are some small buttons doing some small but necessary things, such as resetting things, scrolling and so on.<br><br>I think that I&#039;ll have the &quot;all levels list&quot; on the left dissapear down the edge of the screen when not used, in order to make the whole thing perfectly symmetric.<br>

Wow, that video was really cool!<br>As for the graffiti, I&#039;m still kind of searching for my style... I knew from the start that I wanted the interface to have some sort of black and white graffiti, but I didn&#039;t know exactly what it would look like - that&#039;s what I&#039;m trying to nail down now. I don&#039;t want it to be &quot;cute and curly&quot;, rather I think what I&#039;m going for could be summed up as &quot;stange&quot;. We&#039;ll see how I&#039;ll get there.<br><br>As for the&nbsp; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141223032125im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/hand-money-l.gif" alt="Hand Money Left" border="0"> <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141223032125im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/hand-money-r.gif" alt="Hand Money Right" border="0"> I plan to release the game for free - that way no one can complain about it being buggy and unplayable hehe!

It&#039;s for your own safety though, as you could easily die from boredom if I put all the things I&#039;m currently doing up here. I&#039;m doing... interface stuff -.- So, basically, I&#039;ve been implementing stuff like sliders for sound and music volume, different kinds of buttons, frameworks for how buttons will handle highlighting, checking if the pointer is above them, and so on and so on.<br><br>The main reason why this is so time consuming is that I&#039;m making the entire interface accessable through both mouse and keyboard. I think that will be a really nice feature in the end, especially for those players who prefer to use a controller (which reminds me that I probably should add joystick input too... but that&#039;ll go under the keyboard framework).

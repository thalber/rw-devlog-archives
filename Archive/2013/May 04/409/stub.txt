in a game where you die 10,000,00 times during NORMAL play, you think that an occasional bugged death breaks the game?? Hardly. I&#039;ve logged in probably 20 hrs of RW and haven&#039;t encountered it once.<br><br>also, it&#039;s not like games are released as some perfect ideal of coding perfection. every single one of them has flaws and unfix able things, but that doesn&#039;t stop them from being released and people enjoying them. Fez was for some people an unplayable mess: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141223032125/http://www.bitloaders.com/2012/07/19/fez-developers-will-not-be-fixing-game-breaking-bug-in-patch-re-release/" target="_blank">http://www.bitloaders.com/2012/07/19/fez-developers-will-not-be-fixing-game-breaking-bug-in-patch-re-release/</a> but that doesn&#039;t take away anything from its &quot;worth&quot;. It&#039;s just a part of what game development is. everybody who buys games understands that. I can&#039;t even count how many huge budget AAA games I own that are buggy fuckups, I&#039;m sure that people will understand when you, a lone game dev working in macromedia director, have a few rough edges.<br><br>plus, why not just release it, then do a patch or an update when you feel like sifting through? or hell, just get someone to do it for you (I know 10 programmer friends that would do it in a heartbeat!)<br><br>you&#039;ve spent a huge amount of time on a really really awesome game and you are in the final stretch of the race. it&#039;s worth it! go all the way!

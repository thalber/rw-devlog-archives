Remember that it&#039;s extremely difficult and frustrating though <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231042042im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/tongue.gif" alt="Tongue" border="0"><br><br><b>Update 206</b><br>Finally have something I can show:<br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231042042im_/https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/50146906/rwShow3.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Not much to add really, this is what I&#039;ve spent the last couple of days doing. We started out with the pups just looking like squashed versions of adults, now most of the sprites they&#039;re compromised of are unique and not shared with the player. Other than that they work pretty much exactly the same, just simplified.<br><br>You can pick one up on your shoulders - the animation solution might be a little wink to the puppies in cave story. The one sitting on your shoulders doesn&#039;t affect your movement at all, which doesn&#039;t really make sense, but I have to go with the less frustrating solution <i>sometime</i>, don&#039;t I? You also have both hands free. <br><br>When you have a pup on your shoulders, you can &quot;pick up&quot; an additional one, by just grabbing it. The pup will run next to you, and you can pull it up ledges etc. This is what happens when I have the black pup on my shoulders and the yellow pup attached to my side, in the gif. This pup will also weight you down, and make climbing and jumping slower and less effective.<br><br>This last mode also works for stunned/dead pups. The idea is that when they&#039;re sitting on your shoulders, they are holding themselves in place, but if they are unable to do that you can still drag them along in the second mode. If you for example drag an unconscious pup with you, and it wakes up, it will jump up on your shoulders shortly if that spot is free. <br><br>You might notice that the pups cut into each other a little bit - some of their sprites are below the other pups, some in front. This is an issue when they grab free sprite channels, because they all want to have channels as close as possible to channel 400 or something like that, which means that the first to spawn gets 400, 399, 401 etc, and the next one gets 395, 406, etc. That&#039;s pretty easy to solve, I&#039;ll just have to get around to it.<br><br>Also the framework for pups holding flies/objects is in, and if you throw them at a fly they catch it and eat it. While the player can carry two objects, a pup can only carry one at a time.

Hehe too easy isn&#039;t going to be a problem!<br><br>Actually the very thing you identify as a problem is the thing I want to achieve. Many games have tried to incorporate &quot;moral choices&quot;, but many times it&#039;s just a question of choosing your flavor of progress, red or blue sprites. For example I remember bioshock having the options of &quot;saving&quot; or &quot;harvesting&quot; little sisters (my memory is a bit foggy as i didn&#039;t own the game, just saw it at a friend&#039;s) but both choices were beneficial. This is, I figure, because they didn&#039;t want to have the conflict between emotional stuff and the &quot;play brain&quot; as you call it. In real life though, as I see it, the very definition of a moral choice is going against your &quot;play brain&quot;. <br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231163417/http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.msg974647#msg974647">Quote from: JDance on December 11, 2013, 06:45:20 AM</a></div><div class="quote">Well players usually reduce a game to inputs and outputs after a while and if the pups don&#039;t have any advantage at all the player may feel a bit of conflict between like, the mood and setting of the game on one hand and the actual rules on the other hand.<br></div><br>My idea is that this internal conflict in the player will enhance the mood of the game. The game describe a very harsh world, and choices such as &quot;should I save these children or let them starve&quot; are very harsh choices to go with it. If you are the &quot;inputs outputs&quot; kind of player, the option is always available to ignore them, though!

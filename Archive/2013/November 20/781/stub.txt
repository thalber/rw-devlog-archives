The obvious idea to me is to have them be the other three colors for the multiplayer bears. A) so you don&#039;t have to have a brand new color set for them, and B) when you get to multiplayer you get the idea that &#039;hey!

Like that ever held me back in the past.<br><br>I have, however, been working on the game! More or less the entire pup creature is built now, but it still doesn&#039;t have a lot of interactions. It moves around somewhat intelligently, and can do a lot of tricks like jumping and climbing and crawling in order to get from one place to another. <br><br>It also has a mad complex brain, which is still not entirely finished, but is pretty sweet. This brain works like the lizard&#039;s brain, but this second time around I was more orderly about it. What&#039;s basically going on is that it has a mental record of where it believes all other creatures to be. When they see another creature, this &quot;brain ghost&quot; is updated to the position of that creature. When it doesn&#039;t see the creature, the brain ghost goes on for a bit, simulating basic movement such as turning in corridors etc. <br><br>This means that if it sees you go into an opening, and then you&#039;re out of sight, it will follow through that opening. Seeing the room on the other side, it will <i>assume</i> that you probably went straight forward to the opening on the other side of the room. In reality you might have taken a turn to the left or something. This means that they can be annoyingly confused sometimes if you hurry too much and outrun them, but that&#039;s kind of cute as well <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231042030im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0"> They do this for all other creatures, including lizards and each other.<br><br>If they can see the place where they <i>thought you were</i>, but you aren&#039;t there, they&#039;ll go looking at the place where they last saw you, as a last resort. Then they&#039;ll tag you as &quot;don&#039;t know where this entity is&quot; and will maybe look around for you for a little bit, or go hang out with one of their siblings whose position they are aware of.<br><br>They have a kind of complex pack behavior, where they prioritize what to do, like such (if I remember correctly)<br><br>&nbsp;1 - follow a player I see with my eyes<br>&nbsp;2 - go look for a player whom I <i>think </i>I have an idea of where he/she is<br>&nbsp;3 - follow one of my siblings whom I can see, and who looks like he/she knows where a player is<br>&nbsp;4 - follow one of my siblings who is as clueless as I am<br>&nbsp;5 - keep my head down and hope I won&#039;t get eaten, maybe do a little cautious looking around for pack mates<br><br>You guys will have to educate me on who/whom/whose later. <br><br>Players can also communicate with them, through moving around in some specific ways. I won&#039;t go into detail on that, because I want to send it to James and have him try it out to see if it&#039;s possible for him to figure at least some of it out by himself, or if we need some sort of tutorial. <br><br>They have behavior modes such as &quot;follow player&quot; or &quot;lie low&quot;. They can be picked up, and then they climb to your back and allow you to use both your hands for hunting/wielding weapons. Later I plan to give them an unconscious mode, where if you feed them too little they might still survive a while, but you have to carry them around cumbersomely, with your hands. They can be thrown, which is kind of fun. When thrown, they will grasp anything they can, meaning that you can throw them to a platform above or some other safe space to get them out of danger momentarily. <br><br>They still don&#039;t interact with quite a lot of objects, most notably the lizards. Lizards and pups are invisible to each other, and in fact live in different planes of reality. That has to change. They also need to be hurt by rocks and spears, flies need to flee from them, etc.<br><br>

<b>Update 137</b><br><br>Today I added a little HUD detail, an indicator on the starting screen to how many flies you have to catch this particular hunt. <br><br><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141225164351im_/http://oi36.tinypic.com/b5s1fc.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Later I&#039;ll upgrade it with actual graphics. The functionality is in though, it shows how many flies are needed and how many you have.<br><br>Other than this I added a new thing - saving flies in the den. As some of you might now, the basic premise of the game is that deadly rains haunt the place for several days in a row. The... <i>creature </i>you play needs food to survive, so when the rain briefly stops it goes out to hunt for bugs. It knows how many days the next rain will last, and has to catch one bug for every day. The game is divided into these &quot;hunts&quot;. As the rain season goes on the rains will be longer and longer, demanding you to catch more and more flies in the same limited time. <br><br>The saving bugs feature means that if one hunt demands 4 flies, but you catch 6, you&#039;ll have 2 at the beginning of the next hunt. I don&#039;t know about whether or not to keep this, it seems a bit cheap. Maybe only half of the excess should be stored? That would create complicated rules that would have to be explained in text rather than visually, which is never a good thing. Hm...<br><br>As the creatures are clearly shown as eating the extra flies in-game it has to be assumed that they throw the food up again, especially since in co-operative the players share the same numbers. And then it comes to how long a thrown-up bug would last in a inevitably moist animal den, which is something that&#039;s too squicky for me to be compelled to simulate in code.<br><br>Let&#039;s see where to take this feature. It might stay in, and it might not. In either case, catching excess flies will be the way to measure the high score of a campaign playthrough.

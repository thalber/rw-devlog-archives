The game has two save files, one for co-op play and one for single player. The files are encrypted, so you can&#039;t mess around with them. If there&#039;s no file the game will create one etc etc. <br><br>As you get back to the den after a successfull hunt the game is automatically saved, and when you hit &quot;Continue&quot; in the main menu it&#039;s picked up again.<br><br>Things seem to be working out just fine. Objects that are moved will, for example, be found at the same place after loading. Lizard are a little more complicated, as I don&#039;t <i>want </i>them to be found at the same place after loading. Pretty much the only data I want to save with them is their health, otherwise I&#039;m happy with them emerging from their holes as if they had never existed before. I guess the easiest approach to this will be to just loop through them on save and delete all data that&#039;s not health-related. <br>

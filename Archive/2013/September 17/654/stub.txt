If you&#039;re not sick of playing it by now, it must be quite fun. That&#039;s just plain logic. <br></div>Hahaha yeah, perhaps. But it&#039;s a very different thing for me to play something I&#039;m currently developing, as I simultaneously think about what I want to add etc. That might add a little depth to it, compared to when you guys play. Like, I would obviously not have spent as much time with this game as I have unless I was making it <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141227105819im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/tongue.gif" alt="Tongue" border="0"><br><br>@artemi - That&#039;s a very good point - giving the text a physical presence in the environment! I&#039;ll give it a try for sure!<br><br><b>Update 177</b><br>Started putting the shelter door animation into the game.<br>Also added respawning for waves mode. The game has a bit too many random factors in it for it to feel fair if you suddenly die after 10 minutes of fighting. Stuff like a lizard suddenly deciding to walk backwards and pushing you out from a cliff or whatever. With extra lives it feels a little bit more even, as each death isn&#039;t that big a deal any more.<br><br>You start off with three extra lives (no matter how many players you are) and after waves 5, 10, 15 etc you recieve one more extra life. If you&#039;re two or more players and run out of extra lives and one dies, the surviving player can try to reach the next extra life, and the teammate will spawn.<br><br>Being two players should be a bit better than being one, as you can inflict more harm, but not too much of an advantage as you also die more, and use the same pool of extra lives.<br>

But you&#039;re right, I might need to think twice about it. Gray is no good though, as the backgrounds are grey.<br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141219052733/http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.msg891275#msg891275">Quote from: jamesprimate on May 19, 2013, 04:57:11 PM</a></div><div class="quote">I do!

I&#039;m always hesistant to sending the game to people I don&#039;t know, but your offer seems very tempting... However, James needs to check two things first: That it recieves Joystick input at all, and that it&#039;s possible to move the character with a joystick.

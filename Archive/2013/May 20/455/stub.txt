just emailed this to JLJac, but heck, since people are interested why not loop everyone in?<br><br>&quot;Yessss, joypad/joystick works! Controls are a pretty fluffy (as you assumed, anything other than a direct up/down/left/right on the pad makes problems), but the stick moves the lil guy around and i was able to change buttons and such. Not bad considering you are doing it blind!&quot;<br><br>also, he has a really impressive amount of customization for controls and sandbox mode. you can basically do... anything.

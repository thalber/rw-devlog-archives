Hahahaha! In the next shrek movie my characters will be featured, promise!<br><br><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231042042/http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.msg973232#msg973232">Quote from: Rabbit on December 06, 2013, 05:58:31 AM</a></div><div class="quote">awwww you held that little guys hand awwww<br></div>This game is becoming a very strange mix between ultra-violence and a hand holding-simulator!

How do you juggle between throwing the pup or throwing the spear? <br></div>I&#039;ve been thinking about this, and while it would make sense to be able to hold a spear in the other hand, that would kind of make you question why you&#039;re not able to hold a pup in each hand - and then you would be able to carry all three of them around, which wouldn&#039;t be as fun gameplay-wise, as you pointed out. So for now holding a pup in one hand takes up both of your hand slots - that&#039;s not set in stone though. If it&#039;s just too annoying I might allow you to carry a spear or something simultaneously. <br><br>Thank you everyone for keeping my motivation up <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231042042im_/http://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0"><br><br><b>Update 207</b><br>Made a new version of the pups&#039; path finding, that works in one single calculation, contrary to the ordinary path finding which ticks along in real time as the game is running (to save framerate). The one-shot path finder will be used for when you exit a level, and the pups following you to the next level need to calculate if they are able to follow you, and if so how long it will take them to reach the short cut. <br><br>This path is saved as an array of all the tiles the pup has to pass through in order to get to the exit.<br><br>I also plan on saving the time when a pup is offloaded. That way, if you exit a level while a pup is running towards you, and then quickly re-enter before the pup has caught up, I can calculate how far along its route it will have gotten, and load it on that tile. That way I can fake some activity going on in rooms you are not currently viewing.<br><br>The lizards should probably get some similar treatment. Right now they&#039;re just re-loaded in the same general area where they were offloaded, but not much else is saved. Except their health, of course. Ideally I&#039;d want to be able to exit a room, as I see that a lizard captures a pup and start off towards its den. Then return to the room, and have the lizard and the pup re-loaded, with the pup in the lizard&#039;s mouth, in a reasonable position you might expect it to have reached in the time it was off screen.<br><br>Gah, today I totally broke my rule of &quot;write what you have done, not what you plan to do&quot;... But well. Planning to do those things is the reason why I made a new path finding function for the pups today. More to come, stay tuned.

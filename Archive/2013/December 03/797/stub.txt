Picking apart the two year old animatronic doll of the player character in order to adapt it for smaller size is very interesting. Honestly I had forgotten my solutions for many of the problems, and now have to discover them all over again. Also it&#039;s a challenge, because now we&#039;re down to a size were every pixel counts, and things like pixel displacement because of sprite rotation can have a huge impact on the general appearance.
